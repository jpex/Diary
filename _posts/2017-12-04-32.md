Added 5 new terms to Anki

### Card Set 20

* Symmetry

* Threat Detection

* Stickiness

* Storytelling 

* Structural Forms

About average in difficult.

* Typed out the remaining 13 terms twice. Took about 10 minutes.

### Typography

Added 5 new terms (and 5 illustrations of the terms) to Anki:

* Bowl

* Counter

* Descender

* Diagonal Stroke

* Ear

Used Anki as the learning process for these terms. The illustrations were all answered correctly on the first try, while I consistently made mistakes with the terms 'bowl' and 'counter'.
