* No entry for yesterday. Had an unexpected issue to handle for the day.  

UPD: Studied against 100 cards, 20 of which were new. Did over two sessions. The effects of choosing 'Hard' over 'Good' with these terms is taking effect at this point. There are more cards, but the % of correct answers is closer to 100% now. I am usually answering 'reverse' cards — where the definition is presented and I have to recall the term — with 'Good'.
