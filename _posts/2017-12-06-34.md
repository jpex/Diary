* Completed the reading of *Universal Principles of Design*.

* Studied 19 previous UPD terms.

* Added 5 new cards to Anki:

### Card Set 22

* Veblen Effect

* von Restorff Effect

* Visuospatial Resonance

* Wabi-Sabi

* Visibility

Pretty painless. It would seem that going through terms superficially every day leading up to this point was helpful. For example, the term Visuospatial Resonance is described as:

*"A phenomenon in which an image achieves optimal clarity due to resonance between the spatial frequency of the image and the observer's distance from the image."*

Which I wrote out from memory just now. Repeat exposure to these over the last week seems helpful.

* There are only 3 terms left in UPD. 


### Typography 

Added 5 terms to Anki (with visual examples):

* Shoulder

* Serif

* Hairline

* Ligature

* Finia

Tested against these + old terms, 16 cards in total.
