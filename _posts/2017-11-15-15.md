Tried a new technique — over a 25 minute period, I wrote out as many defintions as I could of upcoming terms. At the halfway mark, instead of continuing, I restarted with the same terms I already wrote, repeating each term twice in the second round (totaling 3 writes). This 25 minute block got me to write 17 terms 3 times. This technique may help with learning by exposing myself to future terms multiple times before I'm obliged to learn them. 

* Studied against 16 older terms in Anki. Was difficult — took about 25 minutes. 

### Card Set 10

* Hierarchy of Needs

* Highlighting

* Hunter-Nurturer Fixations

* Iconic Representaiton

* Horror Vacui

Tested against each in Anki. Prior to this, read and wrote out the terms. Anki test took 9 minutes, significantly better than card set 9.
