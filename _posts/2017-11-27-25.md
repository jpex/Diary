* Studied against 26 existing cards. No distractions for these. Took 25 minutes — I got 2 terms wrong multiple times, but got the other 24 correct. 

Attempted a new anki tactic — I took the next 12 definitions and entered them into Anki prior to reading or typing out the terms ahead of time. I brute forced the terms — typically in a cycle of showing a defintiion, typing it out 3 times, and cycling through cards until I eventually listed out all 12 defintiions. This process took ~90 minutes, broken up with a few minor (<5 min) breaks. Overall, I think this technique may be effective time-wise, but is more mentally draining. This technique may be useful for 5 terms at a time (instead of 12), and once they are remembered for the day, read through those terms in more depth.
