* Studied against 14 existing cards. Despite an increasing number of cards, these cards aren't piling up (assuming that they are tackled daily and not skipped). Took 20 minutes (3 errors, also decided to type out each one twice, once before an answer reveal, and once after).

* Studied against a new card set.

### Card Set 18

* Rule of Thirds

* Satisficing

* Savanna Preference

* Scaling Fallacy

* Scarcity

Was pretty painless in terms of difficult and time. Given that I did go through these cards yesterday (along with all the remaining terms), there was a sense of déjà vu here. 

* 25 minute block: Readining through the above 5 terms. No notes.

* 25 minute block: Typed out the remaining 23 terms twice. Did the same yesterday with the remaining 28. A lot of it felt familiar, just not to the point where I knew all the terms ahead of time. Will be interesting to see if this block really does bring down the time to learning their terms — it seems card set 18 was easy, but that could just be a coincidence.
