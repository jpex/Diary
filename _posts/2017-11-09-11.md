Studied against 20 cards. Took a little less than 25 minutes. Most mistakes were made in more recent cards. Partial explaination could be skipping yesterday caused a disruption in spaced learning. The ones that were missed were not major mistakes, however.

Given a large time slot, I decided to skim through the remaining 95 design principles (125 total, 30 currently committed). At minimum, the term, definition, and examples were read. For many, some of the paragraph text was read. For a few, the entirety was read. There is no reason to believe all these terms are memorized, but in theory, it will be easier to develop recall abilities of these future terms. Time alloted to this: approximentaly 4 hours, over a 5 hour total time slot.
