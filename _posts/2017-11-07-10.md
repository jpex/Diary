Studied against all existing anki cards. Time: 20 minutes.

Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:

### Card Set 5

* Control

* Defensible Space

* Convergence

* Depth of Processing

* Cost-Benefits

Prior to testing against defintions, I wrote down the terms, followed by reading the indepth of each card. The actual test against the 5 cards took 25 minutes before I could recite each.

### Observation of processing

This particular studying took a little less time than others. What jumps out however is the ease of the time felt much less mentally taxing than previous attempts at learning new card sets. Coincidentally, one of the terms, depth of processing, states that information is better recalled when its content are deeply analyzed. In this particular learning acquisition, I read through the inforamtion prior to using anki to memorize the terms. There could be other reasons for why this particular session was easier and faster than others (less tired, naturally easier terms, better environment, etc.), but there is reason to believe I would have a better time acquiring new information if I take a deeper dive into each piece of information first. Will try this on the 6th card set.
