Studied against first 3 anki card decks. Took under 20 minutes (last session a few days ago took over 45 minutes with the same set).

Added 4th deck to anki. Tested against it. 5 new cards took over 30 minutes to complete. 

### Commentary on the anki decks up to this point

This is my first attempt at utilizing anki to learn new material. It certainly seems that the initial learning of terms if by far the most difficult and time consuming aspect of this process, while returning back to cards is relatively quick and easy (assuming I have been faithfull following the process and not missing large chunks of time). While unspurprising, the degree to which it is true, is. In addition, the ability to recall exactly what knowledge I've acquired seems limiting at the moment. Likely, I will need new routes of learning the same material to be able to really tap into the knowledge being acquired. Unfortunately, this particular book has a tendency to use examples that are pretty outdated (TiVo, pre-smart phone Nokias, early 00's GUIs). Cross connecting these terms, and building up working examples of the terms, I suspect will help here.
