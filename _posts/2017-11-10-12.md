Studied against 10 old cards. The ones from the 4th deck were largely here, which I struggled to get through again. 

Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:

### Card Set 7

* Feedback Loop

* Face-ism Ratio

* Expection Effect

* Exposure Effect

* Factors of Safety

Tested against, took about 20 minutes. Towards the more difficult of sets to learn. Possibly because the terms to most of them are long.
