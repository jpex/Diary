Hi there, this site is a public-facing log of my own professional development. (Ideally) each day, I write up what I have studied, practiced, or created.

My primary goal is *process*. This log serves to discipline myself into studying. While I am not sure what I want to do 5 or 10 years from now, I do know that consistent, daily training of the mind is foundational.

Being a UX designer currently, my studies naturally reflect the short term needs of my career. However, I try to approach my studies in terms of my overall vocation.

### Daily Logs

The *daily* time scale is the foundation for development. These logs are a combination of summary and a ‘stream of consciousness’ style of writing. They often contain thoughts going through my head that day. They are volatile, difficult to read, and sometimes contradictory. Thoughts, analysis, decisions, are made here. Daily logs are largely for my own benefit, and not towards other readers.

### Weekly Logs

The *weekly* time scale is a short summary of all that was accomplished in its respective *daily* entries.

## General Approach

### Process over Goals

Goals for me are temporary activities, they serve to feed the process of knowledge acquisition. I am willing to drop a goal if I don't think it's useful anymore. I believe that a work-ethic produced from *process* will be what guides me to determining what goals are important.

### Very Long Term

While my entries are marked by *days*, I try to pursue activities that will help me out *several years* from now. What might help me 5 years from now? 10? 20?

### Spaced Repetition, Reinforced Learning

Going through content once is not enough. Every study listed goes through numerous 'tests' to determine if I know the material. Completed studies are no exception.

### Anki

The software I use for spaced repetition is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), an automatic flash card system. Anki automatically determines what I'm tested on, and when, based on answers I give to flash cards in the past. This system perpetually reinforces what I have learned, and encourages daily practice.
