![Universal Principles of Design Book Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/upd-cover.jpg)

*Universal Principles of Design* is a reference book on 125 design concepts. For this book, I memorized the definitions of every single term. This was done gradually over a course of 2 months. I utilized a program called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to create digital flashcards, and automatically apply a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) learning technique.

Overall, this is a useful reference book for general design principles. It doesn't teach you a specific idea, nor in-depth ideas. With that in mind, it was a useful exercise in grounding a lot of unorganized ideas/opinions into specific terminology. Some of the examples are outdated (Nokia is an example of an aesthetic phone? What year is it?), or used complicated illustrations, but the ideas behind them remain relatively time-tested.

Below are my individual logs for this study.
