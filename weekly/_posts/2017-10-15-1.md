* Started logging my education.

* Started learning the book UPD (*Universal Principles of Design*), a reference book of 125 design terms.

* Created a goal to be able to define every term in the book from memory.

* Started using a spaced repetition system of learning using the software Anki.

* Successfully tested against 20 terms for UPD (20/125 total).
