Tested against 19 previous cards. Somewhat difficult. Time: 22 minutes. Focus level wasn't very high.

Added and tested against 5 new cards.

### Card Deck 9

* Gutenberg Diagram

* Good Continuation

* Hierarchy

* Golden Ratio

* Hick's Law

Took ~30 minutes to get through the test. Was not as much writing practice on these terms prior to the anki test. Overall, like earlier, my focus level was low. These terms will probably give me trouble in the future.

### Meta

As I approach the half way point of *Universal Principles of Design*, the date for a new deep focus topic is approaching. Originally, I planned on deep diving into *About Face* by Alan Cooper first, but went with UPD instead because of an easy adoption to Anki, which is also an experiment here.

There are a few potential deep dive routes:

* About Face (Interaction Design)

* Google, Apple (, and maybe Microsoft)'s design guidelines, including the reproduction of various UI elements.

* Animation (in general)

* An Adobe program such as XD, Illustrator, and/or After Effects

* Graphic Design (Theory)

Many different choices. What I may do is try and do a main dive into a field, and have a minor dive in one or two areas concurrently. I forsee something that blends theoretical and practical application.
