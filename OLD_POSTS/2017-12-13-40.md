* UPD: Studied against 50 cards, 20 of which were new.

I should run out of 'new' cards either tomorrow or the next day. After that, I believe what I will do is self-administer an oral exam of the terms, where success depends on a correct % of answers over a certain amount of time. My initial idea with this is a 30 second time limit per term, which amounts to about an hour of rattling of terms (125 terms, 30 seconds a piece). 

### New Minor Focus: About Face

*About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design* is a new minor focus. Many regard this book as the standard reading on the subject. Without any formal training within interaction design, this would be the logical choice to formalize my understanding.

Given the size of the book, I expect this minor focus, meaning I'm likely to dedicate less than an hour a day to it, to take a few months. 

For today, in one 25 minute session, I read through the table of contents, the forward, and 2 pages of the introduction. What I may do is after completing a chapter, I go back to take notes on the subject.
