### IxD

* Completed notes for the *Goal-Directed Design Research* section.

Added 5 new Anki cards for said section:

* Types of documents to look at in the literature review phase (3)

* Ideally, stakeholder interviews are done:

* Stakeholder

* Types of information to gather from the stakeholder interview phase (5):

* When is it important to meet with subject matter experts (SMEs)? (3)

No particular issues with learning these. I am restraining myself from adding more terms today.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* 19 terms, no issues.

* *Brand:* 0 terms.

* *IxD:* 17 terms, 4 issues. Not surprised, I felt like I was getting lucky in previous sessions with all the correct answers.
