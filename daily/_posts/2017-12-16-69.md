Log layout updates. 

* Pagination Added

* The homepage shows only recent entries now. No longer is every single entry dumped on the homepage.

* Top introduction a little more clear

* No more entry streak information

* Tags on old entries fixed

* New minor focuses have tag pages

* Favicon. Bad pixel art by me of chess' most photogenic piece.

* Page Titles are better

* Some anchors have better indicators of being anchors

Some of these pieces had been done over the last two weeks. Today was dedicated to piecing it together. 

I have some vision of the log itself being a long term asset, related to the thoughts I wrote in the previous entry. These quality of life improvements should help towards this fuzzy goal.
