### IxD

* Retyped out notes for *Qualitative versus Quantitative Data in Design Research* (Ch. 2)

* Read the subsection *Goal-Directed Design Research* (Ch. 2)

* Created 5 Anki cards for a diagram describing the relationship between quantitative research and qualitative research. 

The textual model for these 5 cards:

Market research (quantitative) + Analytics (quantitative)
→ can inform → 
Goal-Directed Design Research (qualitative)
← drives →
Behavioral Models (personas)
← can be used to generate →
Market Sizing Studies (quantitative)




### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: 9 terms. No issues.

* *Branding*: There were no terms/cards. Notable — this is the first time it has happened.

* *IxD*: 14 terms. Two minor issues.
