### IxD: Personas

Read and wrote notes for the subsection *The Power of Personas*.

Created and tested against 3 anki cards:

1. Personas resolve three design issues that arise during product development:

2. Personas help designers do the following: M [???] | Con [???]

3. Personas help designers do the following: D [???] | Com [???] | Build C [???] & C [???]

In an upcoming session I will create more cards for 2./3., i.e. what those 5 pieces mean.

### IxD: Good Product Behavior

Created and tested against 4 anki cards:

1. 3 categories of Interaction Design Principles

2. Interface-level Principles

3. Behavioral Principles

4. Conceptual Principles

The book specifically ties these principles to future chapters. They seem important enough to have cards with no context â€” have to memorize the entire phrasing to get it right. I did trim the wording though.
