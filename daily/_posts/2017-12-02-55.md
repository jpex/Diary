Studied against 37 UPD terms. I ran into some very old terms (I've been doing these terms alphabetically, these were 'A' terms) that I outright forgot, then failed multiple times. Thought it was amusing, and insightful. With Anki, there are 4 'reactions' to answers — again, hard, good, and easy, each impacting how long until the term returns. I've been using 'good' for most scenarios, sometimes 'hard', almost never 'easy', and 'again' when I get it wrong. As I've mentioned in earlier entries, these terms are considerably more wordy than what Anki is typically used for. These old terms make me think I should answer with 'hard' instead of 'good' for UPD term.

Studied against 5 typography terms — a definition and visual portion.

Right now I am thinking that after the *Universal Principles of Design* deep focus is complete, that I do something akin to a major/minor setup. What I have in mind is a major/deep focus on Visual Design, and a minor focus on Interaction Design. I don't think the visual design focus needs to be made more specific at the high level, it would encompass a lot of subcategories (typography, color, iconography, logos, graphic design, etc.). Unlike what I've done up to this point, this deep focus would be  primarily practical execution with a little bit of theory — you can't really get good at visualizations without a lot of actual practice.

The minor focus on interaction design would be via the book *About Face*, and unless the book pushes for practical examples, would be similar to the UPD focus.

### Meta

Need to expand out functionality of this log. Right now this site just dumps every single post, which has a few different problems. I'd like to be able to write up longer, more organized pieces, which this current system can't handle. May start iterating this platform.
