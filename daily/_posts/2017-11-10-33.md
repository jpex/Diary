Studied against 10 old cards. The ones from the 4th deck were largely here, which I struggled to get through again.

Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:

### Card Set 7

* Feedback Loop

* Face-ism Ratio

* Expection Effect

* Exposure Effect

* Factors of Safety

Tested against, took about 20 minutes. Towards the more difficult of sets to learn. Possibly because the terms to most of them are long.

Continued on reading for the 8th card set. Read each indepth, wrote out terms. Will add to, and test with, Anki in the next session.

### Meta

Day streaks are now apart of this page. This ended up being much more tedious to do than anticipated, largely because most of it is done using the liquid templating system, instead of a "real" programming language. Fun in some ways, but also reminds me why I prefer design to development.
