Played around with my randomly generated space work some more:

https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/LQNQrO
Added color to it, tried out a CSS [scrim gradient](https://css-tricks.com/easing-linear-gradients/) to try and create smoother gradients.

I also experimented with more complex CSS stars (ones that look like the large ones [in this wallpaper](https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/129218-digital_art-stars-space-nebula.jpg)). They worked out okay, but I managed to crash my browser when I accidentally made an infinite loop in codepen, and never saved. A pretty silly mistake, but in my defense, codepen sometimes auto-saves.
