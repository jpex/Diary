### Other

Rediscovered a defunct online, open-source textbook site: [Boundless](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/catalog/boundlesscourses). ~1.25 years ago I had an interest in their management course, but never got around to it. Looking at it again, it reminds me a lot of the book *Organizations*. That (or a different business course) might be a useful minor focus in the future to pursue.
