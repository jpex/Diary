### Reinforced Learning

First day in awhile that I missed. 

* *UPD*: 20 terms, 2 issues. Made a really careless error in one of them.

* *Branding*: 4 terms, 0 issues.

* *IxD*: 33 terms, 7 issues. Got a taste of all the common reasons to get a problem wrong â€” outright not remembering, giving an answer to a completely different term, messing up a single (important) word, and refining the answer given.

### Other

The last time I mentioned casual reading, I mentioned starting the book *Mastery*. I've since completed it and started reading *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. I mention this on the possibility that I may work this book (or something similar to it) into a minor focus. Given that the book is much on human behavior, much like Interaction Design is about designing for human behavior, there is a natural connection I want to make.
