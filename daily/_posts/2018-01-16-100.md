Spent a full day rapidly creating high fidelity designs. 

Am not used to mentally rushing for an 8 hour stretch. It's an interesting kind of stress â€” one that seems unsustainable (and ineffective) if there was too much of it, and one that is almost impossible to replicate on your own. I suspect that I will need to work on this skill (speed of application) if I want to push the boundaries of my work.
