Studied against 26 existing cards. For this test, I spoke out the term before writing the term in full. The process of recalling some terms outloud felt weird â€“ I would say the term correctly, and it probably doesn't sound that weird, but I felt like I was searching for a specific string of words in my head to say. For others, I would try and parse out the definition's entire phrase before starting to speak it. For one I confidentally said aloud the term and then wrote it down, only to discover I defined a completely different term. There were a few where I forgot the phrasing of the term and improvised. They were somewhat accurate, but not good enough.
