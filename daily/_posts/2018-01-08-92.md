### IxD

**Reinforced learning:** Tested against 28 cards. 3 errors, pretty good considering that there were poor time gaps for several cards (should have tested 1 day later, but tested 3 days later).

### Reinforeced Leanring

* *UPD:* 39 terms. 1 error. Not doing reinforced learning the previous 2 days made this is a much larger study deck.

* *Branding:* 9 terms. 0 errors.
