### Branding

* Anki reinforced learning: Tested against 11 previous cards. As expected, there were many wrong answers, although not quite as bad as *IxD* was in a session a few days ago.

### IxD

* Anki reinforced learning: Tested against 10 previous cards. As expected, there were many wrong answers. Very wordy terms, much like *UPD* is/was. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* 14 terms in Anki. No issues.

### Animation/Code


Made: https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/jYBpzw

Turns out this only runs well in Firefox. The icons in the color circles are from font awesome, otherwise the rest of the code was made within codepen.

After trying to code this up, and through my deep reading of *About Face*, I feel like I have a better understanding for why I prefer design to development (or maybe, I'm just relearning a lesson over 3 years ago when I was 'trapped' as a front-end developer). Code seems to only be interesting to me if it's a direct result of my own design. It seems that the moment the code is no longer about *me*, my interest in development ends. It's plausible if I ever got into non-UI development that I'd think otherwise, but then again, I was never interested in that because there wasn't human interaction in the work.

This exercise does make me wonder how more "true" UI developers code out these effects, and also how they collaborate with designers to execute it. I remember in the past having to try and code out complex animations where the only direction from design was to 'copy' a style from site *x* (hello Squarespace). I ponder why it's acceptable for myself to reverse engineer some elaborate scrolling animation on a different site, but design couldn't do their own animation in a graphics program and show exactly what they wanted, with their own design artifacts. 

I guess the point of this ramble is to just learn After Effects. Or Framer.
