### IxD

Started typing out notes for the *Goal-Directed Design Research* subsection. In it includes a breakdown of 7 components — I typed through 5.

Created Anki cards for the start of this section:

* A diagram of an overview of Goal-Directed Design Research

* The title/description of the above diagram

* Key questions to ask during the Kickoff meeting of a project (the first of 7 components in this subsection). There are 7 key questions, and I created 4 cards for them — 3 pairs of questions, and one long question.

6 total cards added today. There are now 43 Anki cards just for IxD.

As a general note, I was pretty distracted for most of this. It ended up taking a lot more time than it ought to.

### Reinforced Learning
