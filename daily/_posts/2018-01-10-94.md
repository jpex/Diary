### IxD

* Read through and wrote out notes for the subsection *Qualitative versus Quantitative Data in Design Research* in Chapter 2. I find it interesting how much this book stresses qualitative research — in my last place of work, it felt like nothing that couldn't be quantified was worthless. I barely had any qualitative toolset to work with, too bad I didn't dive into Cooper's methods earlier.

### Organizations

* Read through Chapter 2 (of 6). It's an interesting read — it combines so many of my past and current interests like design, management, economics (my college degree), philosophy (my college minor), and political science (I had two minors). I have always had an interest in organizations and their design, although I haven't (and still don't) known how to connect it to an applicable career path. It does remind me a lot of design as a concept though.
