* IxD: Studied against my 6 previous cards. Unsurprisingly, went poorly.

* Reinforced learning: Studied against 12 *UPD* terms. All correct.

### Visual Design

Explored general ergonomics for creating visualizations. I have an iPad Pro + Pencil, and wanted to try and find a way to use it. A lot of the native apps seem to be geared towards art creation. I did get the app *Duet Display*, which lets the iPad act as a second monitor. This method is probably limiting, as there is no way to have a 'hover' state with the iPad combo. 

Refound a skillshare by Adam Whitcroft called [Icon Design: Create a Cohesive Icon Set](http://skl.sh/adamw). It's a few years old, but should be fine. 

Played around with an Illustrator [pencil tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z38AP9wqGQU) that I ran into when trying to work out a set with an iPad. 

Still not sure how this focus should proceed overall. Have yet to push into a volume of work.
