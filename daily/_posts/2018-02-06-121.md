### Don't Make Me Think

Completed reading of Chapter 2.

Created and tested against 3 Anki cards:

* Web use Fact of Life #2

* Why don't users look for the best choice? We're usually [???] | Stakes are [???] | Weighing options [???]

* Reasons a user might weigh options before they click: Frame [???] | How pressed [???] | How much [???]

Kind of interesting how mental models and satisficing is a reoccurring them in my studies (Dedicated terms in *Universal Principles of Design*, user models in *About Face*, intuitive and deliberate thinking in *Thinking, Fast and Slow).

One interesting reason that a user might weight their options stood out to me: How much confidence they have in the site. Two thoughts came to me — how much branding can shape this perception (and vice versa), and if there is a way for a business to quantify an ROI for usability improvements to improve audience metrics (staying on the platform longer) and brand perception.
