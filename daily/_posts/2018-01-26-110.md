Have missed reinforced learning twice this week, and to make it worse, both were on weekdays. This has been a pretty unproductive week as a whole relative to past weeks. There are a few things I can point to — my work schedule being turbulent, parsing through a difficult book, choosing not to progress on IxD. 

In the interest of preserving process, what I will do is pause my *Organizations* focus for awhile (fully read, but with only notes from Ch. 1), and take on a new minor focus. I don't know if I will elect to abandon *Organizations* — something I might do a few weeks from now is take a quick pass at both *Organizations* and *Branding* again.

I decided on the 'classic' in UX, *Don't Make Me Think*. I've picked up this book from time to time, but I never went in depth with it. Unlike *Organizations*, this book seems to be easy enough to parse into reinforced learning. 


### Reinforced Learning

* *IxD*: 28 terms, 2 issues.

* *Branding*: 4 terms, 0 issues.

* *UPD*: 21 terms, 0 issues.

General note: For some reason, I was very distracted mentally while doing this. Anki suggests I spent 36 minutes on this (over 55 cards), but I spaced out enough that this stretched out to 2 hours. Usually I power through these. My accuracy doesn't suffer doing this (in fact, this is better than most of the last 10 sessions), it just eats away at time.
