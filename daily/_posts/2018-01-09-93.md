Revamped the log to version 2.

Still has bugs and features to be added, but overall a step up from the previous version.

Notable changes:

* A weekly format, in addition to these daily formats.

* A visual refresh.

* Remake of home and about pages.

* Content sorting is now based around the week.

* Permalinks now reflect post date instead of the title.

### New Minor Focus: Organizations

Can't seem to prevent myself from trying to pick up something new. Today, it is *Organizations: A Very Short Introduction*. From the same series as *Branding*, the topic today is in the title.

The logic for choosing this based on recent thoughts that in order to be a successful designer, I need to understand its interrelated subjects. Worst case, this focus will be over before early February and I can move on to something else.

Read the preface and chapter 1 of this book. The book explicitly recommends reading through it before taking notes on each chapter. I'll follow the advice given.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* 12 terms. No issues.

* *Branding:* 2 terms. No issues.

* *IxD:* 4 terms. No issues.
