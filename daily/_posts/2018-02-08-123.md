Spent the day doing UI design (9+ hours)

### Reinforced Learning

* *IxD*: 31 terms, 3 issues.

* *Branding*: 0 terms.

* *Don't Make Me Think*: 8 terms, 3 issues (they were all "correct", but the wording deviated too much for my liking).

* *UPD*: 11  terms, 0  issues.

### Meta

As mentioned yesterday, I've been contemplating a shift in my focus. For the last few weeks, I haven't had a 'major focus' beyond a private project. That work is ongoing, but also much smaller. 

My plan going forward will be as follows:

* Temporarily pause *About Face*. 

* Rapidly finish *Don't Make Me Think*. I want to close out this book faster than the rate I'm currently at. That is the reason for pausing *About Face*. My goal is to read through the book, and have Anki cards ready. When that is done, I will resume *About Face*. I won't add the cards all at once, maybe 2 cards a day until I've exhausted the list. This book is unironically easy to parse, so it shouldn't take too much time.

* My major focus will now be in practical high fidelity UI design. This will be effective as of tomorrow. 

* After *Don't Make Me Think* is completed, I will begin a new minor focus: Direct study of Material Design. This will inevitably coincide with the UI focus.
