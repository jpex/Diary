* UPD: I configured the Anki deck to show reverse cards now. This effectively doubles the number of cards. Anki naturally limits the number of 'new' cards to 20, so today it tested me on the first 20 definitions, in addition to 6 terms like before.

* Typography Anatomy: Tested against 7 older terms. Easier than before.

* I've been thinking out how this site can be more approachable to others. These daily entries are chaos and nuance to virturally everyone. A macro scale of what I am doing would be more presentable. I still consider myself to be the primary user of this log, but there should be a better way to express the general ideas to others.
