### Branding

* Studied against 6 existing Anki cards. A few minor issues, but much smoother than yesterday.


### IxD

* Studied against 7 existing Anki cards. I did get many wrong, but usually by specific wording over completely forgetting things. Am pretty strict with a correct answer here, relative to other decks.

* Reformatted my Chapter 1 notes, which also included retyping them out.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: Tested against 19 terms. No issues. Saw some of these cards won't show up for ~45 days, which is a good sign.

### Code/Visuals

Made a horizontal flowchart for HTML & CSS:

There was a specific use case for this â€” I wanted an easy to build a responsive, simple flowchart that I can easily customize.

I tried out some elaborate ul li hierarchies originally, but creating relationships within them (things like last-child, nth-child, etc.) ending up being a mini-nightmare. Turns out good old div's and an elaborate flex layout makes this kind of layout a lot easier. This can be customized to some degree (for example, the "generation"/columns don't have to line up). For my use case, I limited this to just a grandchild "generation", but I'm sure this could be expanded out to *n* generations.
