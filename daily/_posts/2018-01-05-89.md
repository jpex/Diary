### IxD

* Reinforced learning: Tested against 8 cards. All correct answers (I believe this is a first for IxD).

* Finished out typing the last notes for Chapter 1. The total word count of the Introduction + Chapter 1 in my notes is 4,767 words. Went back and typed out the last subsection later on (notes on the notes).

For this final subsection, I feel like this content is jargon-heavy. This is not to say the content is worthwhile, but there is a part of me that feels that heavy Anki usage here might be an inefficient use of my time. I have read a general criticism of this book a few times now: that this book is (ironically) difficult to parse and too verbose. For example, the definition of 'Interaction Design' includes both the words 'interaction' and 'design', which I think is silly. 

A part of me understands the inforamtion well: I know what a 'user interview' is, and it being an activity in 'Research' makes sense to me. Some of it though, such as 'Defining manifestations of information and functionality' as an activity in the 'Design Framework' portion means nothing to me, and trying to memorize that phrase now doesn't help me understand it. *Maybe* it helps me several chapters from now, but it will also slow me down in getting there.

It's possible that the detailed view of the Goal-Directed Design process won't really be something to comprehend until the details are unearthed in later chapters. This goes in conflict of what I've been suggesting for a few days, but I've only now read it. I think one of my 'goals' for this book then will be to explain this process in a simpler way than the book. 

Added 8 new cards to Anki

* Two reasons to include designers in the research process

* Six phases of Goal-Directed Design 

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Research

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Modeling

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Requirements Definition

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Framework Definition

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Design Refinement

* Goal-Directed Design Process: Design Support

Not a whole lot of issue here. The 6 process terms are very simple. I don't think it's worth pressing the issue with deeper phrasing of these 6 processes, and just try to synthesize a better understanding from the following chapters.


### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* Tested against 7 cards. No issues.

* *Branding:* Tested against 4 cards. Mixed up a definition, otherwise no issues.

### Meta

Played around with a weekly summary layout concept.

### Other

I do some casual reading (i.e. reading without deep interaction with the material) bit by bit. I've made my next book *[Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X)* by Robert Greene (the book I just finished was a biography on Eisenhower). Years ago I got through half of his book *48 Laws of Power*, and I remember I liked the book style (don't remember why I stopped). As the book's content is related to professional work, I'd thought I'd mention it in a log.
