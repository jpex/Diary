Today I was interested in trying to randomly generate work in CSS.

Randomly generated triangles:

Forked from that project, a randomly generated starfield
https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/gvrwoR

For the starfield, I did have some interesting animations to it. Since each star is a div, I could move them across the site. I even tried a 'zoomed' in kind of animation like you were traveling through space (done by scaling up the whole starfield in CSS while also scaling down the div's at the same rate). 

It was a cool effect, but for some reason, browsers would stop generating all of the divs unless you moved your mouse (if you selected one in the dev tools, they stayed on screen). Couldn't find anything online to explain it â€” but I can't necessarily fault a browser for not wanting to generate literally hundreds of divs being animated at once.
