### IxD

* Completed my reading of Chapter 2. 

* Typed out notes up to the point that I finished reading yesterday. This goes from *Behavioral and demographic variables* for persona hypothesis to *putting together a plan* for interviews.

Added and tested against 5 cards to Anki to study against:

* Persona Hypothesis

* Persona hypothesis attempts to address 3 high level questions [decent amount of context per question]

* Roles

* In forming a persona hypothesis, for *business products*, use [???], which roughly map to [???], to get a reasonable [???].

* In forming a persona hypothesis, for *consumer products*, the most significant patterns emerge from users' [???][4], which all can influence their behavior.

I wonder how useful these verbose terms would be. A big reason for me providing so many words in some of these is meant to improve the speed that I get through the overall book.

Instead of asking something like:

* Best way to form a business product persona hypothesis:

I ask:

* In forming a persona hypothesis, for *business products*, use [???], which roughly map to [???], to get a reasonable [???].

Would I be better off would the former? I lean towards no for this. 

Unrelated to this, with these IxD cards I sometimes search for specific concepts (e.g. Persona Hypothesis, Ethnographic Interviews) online. A lot of the results end up citing this book to define the phrases. It's a little amusing â€” I saw one site that used his/her site as notes for the exact same subsection I'm on.
