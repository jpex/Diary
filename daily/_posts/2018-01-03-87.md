### IxD

**Reinforced Learning:** Tested against 5 existing cards. Two minor errors. Retyped out the two chapter subsections from yesterday. 

* Typed out notes for Chapter 1's subsection *Implementaiton Models and Mental Models*.

Created 5 Anki cards for Chapter'1 subsection *Recognizing User Goals*, which include:

* Both activites and tasks are...

* Hierarchy of Activities

* Activity Theory

* Activities and tasks are transient, because...

* In relation to users, it's the designer's job to (2)...

Tested against these cards, with only minor difficulties. For this one, I typed out the terms and definitions many times over before doing the actual test of them.

I think this chapter subsection approach is making sense. Not all subsections are created equal, but a good general format for learning the material might be:

* Reinforced learning of old terms, and retyping out notes from subsection *x*

* Retyping out notes from subsection *y*.

* Typing out new notes from subsection *z*.

* Going back to subsection *y* and extracting out potential cards to create and test.

And repeat when complete. The time between each 'task' here (to borrow phrasing from this book) would naturally vary based on a subsection's material. For example, many of the subsections in Chapter 1 might need less than 5 Anki cards, but the last subsection of chapter 1, which gives a detailed overview of the entire focus of chapters 2â€“6, might take many days to get through.

* Update: Attempted to type out the notes for the final subsection, *An Overview of Goal-Directed Design*. It's possible this subsection is the single most important subsection in this book. Being able to recall this particular information would be critical to being able to describe the entire design process on a high level, and in theory, will make the next 5 chapters much easier to process. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: Tested against 9 cards. 1 incorrect (did not accept 'phenomenon' as a substitute for 'property' in a definition).

* *Branding*: Tested against 3 cards. No issues.

### Meta

Explored more ideas for the 'weekly' category. Decided to put that on GitHub rather than here.
