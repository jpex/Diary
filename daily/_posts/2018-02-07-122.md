Have had some setbacks lately. I am unsure what the proper remedy is, but I do think it will involve shifting priorities here. Today was intentionally light as a whole. Right now, I think my plan of action is shift into actual design artifacts as a major focus. I've been in a pretty big rut: this feeling of needing to master a trifecta of product — viability, aka business, desirability, aka design, and capability, aka development — yet I also feel like this is a mistake. A story on my mind is of Mozart and his apparent "explosion" of work at the end of his short life. As though what I should — what I must — focus on is pumping out a massive amount of design work. I could probably write endlessly on this subject, but will leave it at this.
