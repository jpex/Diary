### Reinforced Learning

Did not do for 2 consecutive days.

* *Branding*: 3 terms, 0 issues.

* *Don't Make Me Think*: 14 terms, 4 issues.

* *UPD*: 34 terms, 1 issue (first time in awhile for UPD where I completely blanked on a term. Was *Mimicry*.).

* *IxD*: 49 terms, 1 issue. Impressive given how many cards there were.
