### UI/Motion

https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/rJmGmY

For the most part I was able to replicate [Recreating Usability with Motion: The UX in Motion Manifesto](https://medium.com/ux-in-motion/creating-usability-with-motion-the-ux-in-motion-manifesto-a87a4584ddc) in CSS. Some were hackish (Dimensionality comes to mind), some I don't think are plausible in pure (S)CSS.


### Reinforced Learning

Did not do for 2 consecutive days.

* *Branding*: 3 terms, 0 issues.

* *Don't Make Me Think*: 14 terms, 4 issues.

* *UPD*: 34 terms, 1 issue (first time in awhile for UPD where I completely blanked on a term. Was *Mimicry*.).

* *IxD*: 49 terms, 1 issue. Impressive given how many cards there were.
