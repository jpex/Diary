### IxD

**Reinforced Learning:** Tested against 5 existing cards. Two minor errors. Retyped out the two chapter subsections from yesterday. 

* Typed out notes for Chapter 1's subsection *Implementaiton Models and Mental Models*.

Created 5 Anki cards for Chapter'1 subsection *Recognizing User Goals*, which include:

* Both activites and tasks are...

* Hierarchy of Activities

* Activity Theory

* Activities and tasks are transient, because...

* In relation to users, it's the designer's job to (2)...

Tested against these cards, with only minor difficulties. For this one, I typed out the terms and definitions many times over before doing the actual test of them.

I think this chapter subsection approach is making sense. Not all subsections are created equal, but a good general format for learning the material might be:

* Reinforced learning of old terms, and retyping out notes from subsection *x*

* Retyping out notes from subsection *y*.

* Typing out new notes from subsection *z*.

* Going back to subsection *y* and extracting out potential cards to create and test.

And repeat when complete. The time between each 'task' here (to borrow phrasing from this book) would naturally vary based on a subsection's material. For example, many of the subsections in Chapter 1 might need less than 5 Anki cards, but the last subsection of chapter 1, which gives a detailed overview of the entire focus of chapters 2â€“6, might take many days to get through.



### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: Tested against 9 cards. 1 incorrect (did not accept 'phenomenon' as a substitute for 'property' in a definition).

* *Branding*: Tested against 3 cards. No issues.
