### IxD

* **Reinforced Learning:** Tested against 10 cards. 1 incorrect, a good sign. Retyped out *Recognizing User Goals* subsection.

* For *Implementation Models and Mental Models*, created 3 new cards for Anki.

* Implementation Model

* Mental Model

* Representation Model

*Universal Principles of Design* already had a comprehensive definition for *mental model*, so I pulled that in for this. As expected, that term had no issue. Did not have large issues with these new terms.

As mentioned in earlier logs, there is one last section of Chapter 1, but will take much longer to complete than these other sections. Won't move on to Chapter 2 until I feel I have the entire Goal-Directed design process overview down in memory.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: Tested against 10 terms. No issues.

* *Branding*: Tested against 1 card. No issue.

### Other

Spent most of the day on private design projects.
