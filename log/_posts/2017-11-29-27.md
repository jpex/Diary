* Studied against 14 existing cards.

### Card Set 17

* Readability

* Recognition Over Recall

* Red Effect

* Redundancy

For an hour, divided into two sessions, I decided to type out the definitions for all 28 remaining definitions, twice. The process was repeated. Based on my experience and understanding of spaced repetition, this exercise of stretching through many terms will probably only be useful if I keep coming back to it. This list of 28 will naturally shrink as well when new card sets are added each day.
