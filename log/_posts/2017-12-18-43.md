### UPD

Studied against 100 cards, 10 of which were new. Done over two 25 minute blocks. There are technically 2 'reverse' cards left.

As I reflect more on this focus, I think achieving a certain 'score' on an oral test would be sufficient to close out this focus. In thinking of the term *Depth of Processing* from this book, I am left to believe that there would be significant diminshing rates of return to contiune with the major focus beyond this. With 125 separate terms, most of these terms would be justified with their own books. The nature of this learning acquisition is many superficial connections, and a greater understanding and appreciation for these terms likely means learning more about them elsewhere. 

I see *UPD* being a sort of glue to other ideas and concepts, not the definitive source of knowledge. For example, in the book *Branding*, I see a phrase 'MAYA' (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable), a term I first discovered in *UPD*. In reading through UX articles on medium, I encounter a lot of references to gestalt psychology, which has several terms scattered in UPD. In the long run, I believe this focus will help me make connections that I may not have made otherwise, but I believe it will be in other works that I acquire a deeper meaning on a subject. With that in mind, *UPD*'s best offering will be my ability to actively recall terms and definitions, and being able to apply them to explore a concept in more detail.

For immediate goals, I will try to do a full oral test two days from now, with the following rubric:

* I must say the term's definition out loud, without any writing assistance.

* I am limited to 30 seconds a term (can be auto enforced through Anki).

* To pass, I must get at least 115 of 125 (92%) correct. 

* If I fail overall, I will retake this test every 2 days until I achieve a passing 'grade'.
