Spent most of the day designing and coding a revamp of this log, using both a daily and weekly feature.

My time studying interaction design has given me a better perspective on the design and development dichotomy. It's interesting how much different I think of how to *represent* a daily and weekly log to an end user, versus how to *implement* said system.

Like the good developer I am, this project is larger in scope than I anticipated, and taking more time than I would like it to.

**Tangent**

This brings me back to a pretty common question asked in the field â€” *"Should designers learn to code?"*. For me, it's not about whether I should know tool X, or HTML/CSS to work my way into the design field. Rather, I wonder, in the very long run (10+ years), what the value is in understanding implementation models from the perspective of being a design expert. I'm speaking in terms of being a leading figure in the application of design, not necessarily being a lead/chapter/director product designer at company Y. If a designer in the digital era is meant to bridge the mental models of people with the implementation models of computers, it seems like you would need to be in an expert in understanding humans. But, does the same apply to the actual mechanisms of the world?

This thinking I feel is making many assumptions, and leaving out other ideas.
