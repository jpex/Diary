Wanted to spend the day pushing forward my two minor focuses. They aren't making enough progress for my liking, but also I want to continue to churn over thoughts about the major focus.

### IxD

* Tested against 3 existing cards. Got all 3 right (a few days ago, these cards took 5+ retries to get).

* Retyped out my introduction notes. Was able to type from memory the Anki cards I pulled from my notes.

* Typed out my initial written notes for Chapter 1.

* Continued to type out notes for Chapter 1. 

I'm surprised at how slow this is. I don't feel like I'm moving slow, rather this is dense material. Going back and typing these notes, I don't remember a lot of these details from the first reading. Given that this is the introduction to the main method prescribed by this book, it would be foolish to push through this content faster. I do wonder if I will be able to move through future content faster.

For context, I have 16 pages worth of notes in Google Docs (a very liberal use of white space to be fair) for just the first half of chapter 1. I've spent maybe 3 hours in note taking just for that first half of one chapter. Naturally, this content will also need to be repeated many times over, and will only add more time to this. I have to wonder if I should allocate more time to this book.

### Branding

Finished note taking for chapter 1. Retyped out the notes from the chapter.

Typed out notes for about 2/3rd of chapter 2. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: 11 terms over 7 minutes (semi-distracted). No issues. Most of the cards I got correct had 7+ days before they'd be seen again. 

### Other

* Read [Net Promoter Score Considered Harmful](https://blog.usejournal.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it-fe7a132f4430) (and What UX Professionals Can Do About It) by Jared Spool. Was an interesting read on a KPI that I haven't had experience using. *Update:* I originally found this on Medium. When going to Spool's twitter, I found a [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16003514) posting for it, which included responses from Spool himself. Very useful to run into responses to articles like this. Is interesting how much better a place like Hacker News (or reddit) *can* be about discussions vs. Medium, and especially vs. Twitter. 

* Found an interesting source of material yesterday night â€” [The Encylopedia of Human Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed). It begins with a testiomy from Don Norman, a character that I have already ran into a few times in *About Face*. It's free, and appears to be quite expansive in content. With how large *About Face* seems though, I would be quite hesistant for any degree of focus to be dedicated to this material (for now).
