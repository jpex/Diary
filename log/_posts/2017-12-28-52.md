* Anki reinforced learning: Tested against 11 previous cards. As expected, there were many wrong answers, although not quite as bad as *IxD* was in a session a few days ago.

* Anki reinforced learning: Tested against 10 previous cards. As expected, there were many wrong answers. Very wordy terms, much like *UPD* is/was.

* *UPD:* 14 terms in Anki. No issues.
