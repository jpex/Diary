Tested against 32 cards. Took about 35 minutes. 

Created and tested against the next anki set.

### Card Set 7

* Fibonacci Sequence

* Figure-Ground Relationship

* Fitts' Law

* Flexability-Usability Tradeoff

* Five Hat Racks

Studying these 5 took about 15 minutes within anki. Studied them off and on again for ~30 minutes in the hours prior.

Created and tested against an 8th anki set.

### Card Set 8

* Forgiveness

* Freeze-Flight-Fight-Forfeight

* Garbage In—Garbage Out

* Form Follows Function

* Framing

Tested against in Anki. Took 6 minutes (compared to ~20–30 minutes of most first time tests). It could be false sense of accomplishment via short term memory, but these particular terms felt very easy to learn. I definitely remember the examples from when I went ahead and read through the remainder of this book. In any case, this *should* be a straightforward set to remember (we'll see tomorrow).

The information here is useful. At a future point, it may be useful to me to formalize how to describe these illusions. In the event I do a deep dive into icon design or typography, this should become even more important.
