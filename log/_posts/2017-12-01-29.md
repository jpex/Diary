* Studied against 32 existing cards. Had a historically consistent correct percent of around 85%.

* Studied against a new card set.

### Card Set 19

* Self-Similarity

* Serial Position Effects

* Shaping

* Signal-to-Noise Ratio

* Similarity

Was relatively painless — less than 15 minutes, including entry into Anki.

* Read more in-depth to the above set of terms.

* 20 minute block: Typed out the remaining 18 cards. At this point, I am starting to confuse which terms I've recently finished and which terms remain. I consider this a good thing, as when I learn them doesn't have much bearing in their practical application in the future (e.g. Did I learn similarity before scarcity? Does this matter? No.). Outside of a single complex term — Visuospatial Resonance — it seems like the remaining terms should be painless to learn.

* 20 minute block: Repeat above practice. Done over an hour apart.

### Introducing a light focus: Typography Anatomy

At this point, I feel comfortable with the rate that *Universal Principles of Design* is moving, and how it has been going. The time efficiency of these terms as improved, leaving me with more time to do other things. I could use that time to learn UPD at an accelerated rate, or make deeper connections with existing terms, but I would rather not. Those things will come in time, there is no need to accelerate this.

Instead, I believe it is more valuable to study something closely related, but distinctly different from this. Based on my understanding of how the act of learning works, oscillating between subjects can bridge connections between the subjects.

I chose typography anatomy/terminology for three reasons:

1. It has been on my mind for the last few days.
2. An opportunity to use Anki in a theoretically more efficient way. Anki is a tool commonly used by medical and foreign language students. This kind of typography learning resembles basic terminology and visualizations better than the more abstract terms in UPD.
3. If I want to move on to another focus, or dive deeper into typography, this subject is easy to modify to reflect this desire.

My understanding of typography terms is already there to some degree, to the point that this focus will not much external structure. What I am doing right now is taking type terms from [Typedia](http://typedia.com/learn/only/anatomy-of-a-typeface/) and [Typography Deconstructed](https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary) and forming terms worth learning.

For today, I created five terms. For each term, I also ripped the visual example in Typography Deconstructed and they also have a card. The five terms today were:

* Aperture (using [this](https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary/aperture) as the visual example in one card)

* Apex (same as above, and all following cards)

* Arm

* Ascender

* Baseline

These terms were substantially easier to remember and recall than UPD terms. This makes sense since they are all more simple concepts.

For this focus, I expect that at the very least I exhaust all the terms mentioned in Typedia, with working visual examples of each. I may try and find a way to deconstruct the anatomy of text in more complex and written ways in the future.
