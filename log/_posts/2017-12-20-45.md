### UPD Oral Test

**Goals:**

* Give the definition to all 125 terms in *Universal Principles of Design* orally.

* No more than 30 seconds to a term (62 minutes total for the entire deck).

* Get at least 115/125 terms correct.

**Results:**

* **122/125** correct results (97.6%)

* 41 minutes total time.

Incorrect responses to:

*Mimicry*, *Interference Effects* (gave definition for *Expectation Effects*), *Gutenberg Diagram* 

### What's next for UPD

I was surprised that I was able to do this well on the first attempt. I didn't attempt any 'cram' studying for this, just what I've documented in this log up to this point. I was a little generous with what a 'right' answer is (e.g. mixing up the words 'recall' and 'memory', 'method' and 'technique'), but not in a way that changed the meaning.

With these results, I mark the end of my first major focus — *Universal Principles of Design* is complete. As mentioned in previous logs, this will continue to receive passive work via spaced repetition, but won't be actively worked on beyond that.

### A Brief Postmortem to UPD

* Focus began: October 10th

* Final term added to Anki: December 6th

* Focus ended: December 20th

* Number of logged days: 40. There are 72 actual days between Oct 10th and Dec 20th.

* There was a 2+ week hiatus towards the start — no entries between October 13th and November 1st. 

I am unsure of the total time commitment over those 40 sessions — many were well past 2 hours, some were under 30 minutes. I will take a guess and say the average session time was 90 minutes, or 60 hours of deliberate focus time to UPD.

My primary goal here is process goal, with quality of material learned a secondary goal. Overall, I would have liked for 40 sessions to *not* be spread out over 72 days, but this is still better than earlier periods of my life. The ratio of logged sessions to days is better if you discount my starting hiatus — 40 for 72 (55%) becomes 36 for 50 (72%), which is slightly above 5 days per 7 day week. This ratio is less important to me for an individual minor focus, but should be set high for cumulative minor focuses, and whatever the major focus of the time is. 

In terms quality of material learned, I feel it will be dependent on its ability to synthesize with narrower, more in-depth specialties. For example, will it help me in learning Interaction Design? Visual Design? Research? Will it help me in articulating design to other designers, developers, stakeholders, and/or the general population? The book in of itself is just bullet points to many different ideas — being able to rattle off a definition for *accessibility* doesn't make me an expert in the subject. 

### Next major focus: TBD

I didn't expect to easily pass my proposed metrics for UPD, and was hoping to delay having to make a decision on my next major focus for a few days. I suspect I will move forward with Visual Design as an umbrella major focus, and keep *IxD* in the minor slot. I'll use the upcoming days to research out a general path for visual design, and at least make the commitment to move forward before the year ends.

Update: Did some research into what a visual design focus would look like. Peaked through some paid courses, wrote out a list of visualizations I want to practice. I don't see an "end" to this focus — UPD had a much clearer "end". I suspect that an "end" will be after some combination of a new focus of mine demanding the major spot, and after I have went through enough practical work in the subjects I want to tackle. As mentioned in earlier logs, process of learning, not quality of learning, is my top priority. 

### Branding

* 25 minute block: Began note taking for book. Through introduction + first third of chapter 1.

### IxD

* Wrote out notes for pages 8–10. I think Anki can be used for a few terms, and also for some of the figures. Should help in recall of the main stages in the interaction design process.

Read the article [The Loyalty of Images](https://medium.com/@matt_yow/the-loyalty-of-images-6629b6a60834). Kind of a blend of philosophy, linguistics, and semiotics (meaning–making). Coincidentally, my *Branding* notes today also talked about signifiers. 

Updated the 'Completed Studies' styling.
