### Visual Design, Probable Change

Hamburger icon + interaction: https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/eyBwoo

Today I've thought about redefining this major focus. I still haven't really determined a sense of direction for this, and don't feel like I'm going to find one either.

Practical application of design however remains a top priority of mine. I think I ought to expand the scope of the focus. This is only something I've definitively felt today, so I'll let this idea sit in my head for a little while before doing so.



### Branding

Retyped out of my notes. 

### IxD

Studied against all 6 cards. Much better than 2 days ago. Was strict with answers (e.g. using 'use the ___' instead of 'interact with the __' was marked wrong).

### Reinforced Learning

Tested against 32 *UPD* terms. 31/32 correct. Total number of cards higher due to skipping yesterday.
