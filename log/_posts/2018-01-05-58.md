### IxD

* Reinforced learning: Tested against 8 cards. All correct answers (I believe this is a first for IxD).

* Finished out typing the last notes for Chapter 1. The total word count of the Introduction + Chapter 1 in my notes is 4,767 words.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* Tested against 7 cards. No issues.

* *Branding:* Tested against 4 cards. Mixed up a definition, otherwise no issues.
