### IxD

* Reinforced learning: Tested against 8 cards. All correct answers (I believe this is a first for IxD).

* Finished out typing the last notes for Chapter 1. The total word count of the Introduction + Chapter 1 in my notes is 4,767 words. Went back and typed out the last subsection later on (notes on the notes).

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* Tested against 7 cards. No issues.

* *Branding:* Tested against 4 cards. Mixed up a definition, otherwise no issues.

### Meta

Played around with a weekly summary layout concept.

### Other

I do some casual reading (i.e. reading without deep interaction with the material) bit by bit. I've made my next book *[Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X)* by Robert Greene (the book I just finished was a biography on Eisenhower). Years ago I got through half of his book *48 Laws of Power*, and I remember I liked the book style (don't remember why I stopped). As the book's content is related to professional work, I'd thought I'd mention it in a log.
