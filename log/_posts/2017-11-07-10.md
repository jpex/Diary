Studied against all existing anki cards. Time: 20 minutes.

Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:

### Card Set 5

* Control

* Defensible Space

* Convergence

* Depth of Processing

* Cost-Benefits

Prior to testing against defintions, I wrote down the terms, followed by reading the indepth of each card. The actual test against the 5 cards took 25 minutes before I could recite each.

### Observation of processing

This particular studying took a little less time than others. What jumps out however is the ease of the time felt much less mentally taxing than previous attempts at learning new card sets. Coincidentally, one of the terms, depth of processing, states that information is better recalled when its content are deeply analyzed. In this particular learning acquisition, I read through the inforamtion prior to using anki to memorize the terms. There could be other reasons for why this particular session was easier and faster than others (less tired, naturally easier terms, better environment, etc.), but there is reason to believe I would have a better time acquiring new information if I take a deeper dive into each piece of information first. Will try this on the 6th card set.

### Continuation within the same day

Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:

### Card Set 6

* Design by committee

* Desire Line

* Development Cycle

* Entry Point 

* Errors

For these terms, I went through this process before committing the cards to Anki:

* Read all 5 definitions, followed by writing out all 5 definitions.

* Read the page on each individual term. Wrote the definition again. At a new entry, I would go back and rewrite the definition of a prior term.

* Retyped each principle and definition at least 3 times. 

* Waited ~10 minutes.

* Retyped each principle, followed by attempting to retype each term from memory.

* Added each term to Anki.

* Waited ~10 minutes, tested against Anki. No incorrect answers, repeated each term twice. Took 7 minutes.

Since this is all in the shortrun, I wouldn't have all these terms locked down in memory. However, this basic approach felt like the easiest and most enjoyable of anki card sets. Will attempt this more.
