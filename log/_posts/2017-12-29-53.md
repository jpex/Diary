### Branding

* Studied against 6 existing Anki cards. A few minor issues, but much smoother than yesterday.


### IxD

* Studied against 7 existing Anki cards. I did get many wrong, but usually by specific wording over completely forgetting things. Am pretty strict with a correct answer here, relative to other decks.

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: Tested against 19 terms. No issues. Saw some of these cards won't show up for ~45 days, which is a good sign.
