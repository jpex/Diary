### Branding

* *Typed* out my current notes. Was significantly faster than my original writing â€” had enough time to write them all out, then continue to type out new notes within chapter 1. 

### IxD

Re-typed out my notes from the introduction, and did it again.

Added 6 cards to Anki:

* Interaction Design

* 'UX has three overlapping concerns...'

* 'Interaction Design is concerned with...'

* Design Principles

* Design Patterns

* Design Process

Was destroyed by those terms in testing. I haven't been so consistently wrong with quizzing since the first third of *Universal Principles of Design* (the book got easier overtime once I started going through future terms superficially on a regular basis). I ended up spending much more time with *About Face* then I intended, as I didn't expect to spend 45 minutes testing against 6 cards (in addition to adding the cards into the system, a quick pre-study of the terms, and typing out the intro notes twice). 

While frustrating to go through, it does reinforce the idea in my head that I should approach this book slowly in terms of general progression, how much like how *UPD* was. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: 13 cards over 7 minutes. All correct.
