### Branding

* *Typed* out my current notes. Was significantly faster than my original writing — had enough time to write them all out, then continue to type out new notes within chapter 1. 

### IxD

Re-typed out my notes from the introduction, and did it again.

Added 6 cards to Anki:

* Interaction Design

* 'UX has three overlapping concerns...'

* 'Interaction Design is concerned with...'

* Design Principles

* Design Patterns

* Design Process

Was destroyed by those terms in testing. I haven't been so consistently wrong with quizzing since the first third of *Universal Principles of Design* (the book got easier overtime once I started going through future terms superficially on a regular basis). I ended up spending much more time with *About Face* then I intended, as I didn't expect to spend 45 minutes testing against 6 cards (in addition to adding the cards into the system, a quick pre-study of the terms, and typing out the intro notes twice). 

While frustrating to go through, it does reinforce the idea in my head that I should approach this book slowly in terms of general progression, how much like how *UPD* was. 

### Visual Design

Briefly went through some interesting framework articles from [Priyanka Godbole](https://blog.prototypr.io/@priyanka_godbole). Topics include web color, spacing, and type systems.

Acquired Adobe Illustrator.  I went through some of [a tutorial on Illustrator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgmu8RwLi28). The mechanics remind me a bit of Photoshop and Sketch, leading me to believe I should be fine with the application itself. Actual execution is of course still up in the air.

The immediate issue I ran into was how physically awkward it is to use a graphics editor program. Pen tools are particularly bad. This machine, a Macbook, only has the mouse in the center. 

This dexterity challenge in the physical interaction with a computer is perpetual for me, and maybe why I didn't really dive into digital illustrations 10+ years ago. I'm left handed, and am entirely conditioned to use my right hand for a mouse. Using my left hand for a navigation system feels awkward, when it really shouldn't. For most computer tasks, using my right hand is a non-issue. It's when pinpoint percision with smooth movement comes into the play that it feels physically impossible to express good movement — I'm not right handed, I have no experience in using my left hand, a mouse itself is generally regarded as inferior to a tablet pen in this case, and a mostly untrained artistic capacity. 

On further reflection, I wouldn't be surprised if this is limiting me in other programs like PS and Sketch. After a short period of time with Sketch, I became more comfortable with it than PS, despite having many more years experience with PS. There is a natural argument to made about the UX/product philosophy of the programs itself, but one important difference with my Sketch workflow is how quick I am to entering in numerical values into dialogue boxes (aka a lot of keyboard control). Sketch just felt easier to do that, and now I wonder if part of my preference for it has to do with this awkwardness with precision. This will be an interesting topic to reflect on — whether or not part of my own sub-design interests have been influenced by how well I can physically interact with a computer.

Either way, I will need to do more research into figuring out a best path forward with this. If I'm going to do any kind of illustrations, it's logical to want to use my dominant hand. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD*: 13 cards over 7 minutes. All correct.

### Other

Read an article titled *[Designing Great Design Communication](https://medium.muz.li/design-docs-6bb34589f7a9), How to make your documentation work: bring common sense, evangelize ideas, explain complicated things*.

Not immediately useful, but a good read on a designer's ability to explain things, from a presentation to stakeholders, to a detailed dev document handoff.
