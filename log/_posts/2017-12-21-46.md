### Visual Design

**Isometric squares in CSS/HTML:**

[https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr](https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr)

I ran into an article in the morning on creating isometric effects in illustrations. Titled, [How I became an Illustrator by discovering a new dimension](https://design.zeta.in/how-i-became-an-illustrator-by-discovering-a-new-dimension-1dbc99bba7a5), I thought it would be interesting to try off part of the technique.

I decided to try out the technique using HTML & CSS. It was curiosity as to whether or not the technique would easily translate into CSS. It worked well (at least in this isolated environment), and from there just dived into playing around with the effects within CSS. 

I added a "tutorial" for it as well in there. This was mostly to play around with *flex* layouts (the bulk of my CSS experience derives in a layout era where IE8 & 9 were a high priority, aka before flex was close to standard).

One could argue this was really a 'front-end' project, and not a 'visual design' project. I am comfortable enough with CSS through years of using it that the bulk of my time and effort was spent understanding the isometric perspective. CSS is just a substitute for a graphics editor. I don't intend for most projects in this focus to use code though, mostly because I ought to get practice in other environments.

### Visual Design Path

I don't anticipate making a clear route for my visual design learning. There are specific things I want to learn at the tool level:

* Adobe Illustrator

* Adobe After Effects

* Another animation tool (Maybe Framer)

There are other potential tools as well — InDesign, XD, deeper Photoshop learning, new age CSS layouts.

Then there are specific areas of visual design I know I want to get practice on:

* Iconography

* Data visualization

* UI Elements

* (Web) Color Theory

There are other potential areas as well — logos, graphic design fundamentals, illustrations.

I don't want to spend much of my time in reading about visual design. I'd say 20% of my time at max. This does *not* pertain to what my minor focuses are.

### Branding

* Wrote out notes for a few pages within CH 1. I am suspicious of writing out these notes as an time-effective tool. Typing them out would be (obviously) faster, which might aid me in going through repeititon of ideas faster, thus leading to acquired memories. I used writing under 10% of the time with *UPD*, I think I can apply the same logic here. 

### IxD

*Typed* out my introduction notes that I originally wrote out. Retyping them out took much less time than the original writing (partially because you don't have to parse them out from the book). 

You could make the argument that, all else constant, writing out the notes is superior to typing them out in terms of remembering the content. The speed variable however allows for what I consider a more important technique for rembering: repeated exposure. 

I think what I will do is continue to type out what I have written so far for Chapter 1, then retype out my notes, then compile key points and try them out on Anki. 

### Reinforced Learning

* *UPD:* Consolidated the cards back to only showing the term (used to also include the reverse, which shows the definition instead). Tested against 30 terms over 16 minutes, with all correct answers. Typed out answers. Number of terms should decrease overtime, assuming I continue to answer terms correctly.
