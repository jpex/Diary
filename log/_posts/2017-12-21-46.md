### Visual Design

**Isometric squares in CSS/HTML:**

[https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr](https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr)

I ran into an article in the morning on creating isometric effects in illustrations. Titled, [How I became an Illustrator by discovering a new dimension](https://design.zeta.in/how-i-became-an-illustrator-by-discovering-a-new-dimension-1dbc99bba7a5), I thought it would be interesting to try off part of the technique.

I decided to try out the technique using HTML & CSS. It was curiosity as to whether or not the technique would easily translate into CSS. It worked well (at least in this isolated environment), and from there just dived into playing around with the effects within CSS. 

I added a "tutorial" for it as well in there. This was mostly to play around with *flex* layouts (the bulk of my CSS experience derives in a layout era where IE8 & 9 were a high priority, aka before flex was close to standard).

One could argue this was really a 'front-end' project, and not a 'visual design' project. I am comfortable enough with CSS through years of using it that the bulk of my time and effort was spent understanding the isometric perspective. CSS is just a substitute for a graphics editor. I don't intend for most projects in this focus to use code though, mostly because I ought to get practice in other environments.

### Visual Design Path

I don't anticipate making a clear route for my visual design learning. There are specific things I want to learn at the tool level:

* Adobe Illustrator

* Adobe After Effects

* Another animation tool (Maybe Framer)

There are other potential tools as well — InDesign, XD, deeper Photoshop learning, new age CSS layouts.

Then there are specific areas of visual design I know I want to get practice on:

* Iconography

* Data visualization

* UI Elements

* (Web) Color Theory

There are other potential areas as well — logos, graphic design fundamentals, illustrations.

I don't want to spend much of my time in reading about visual design. I'd say 20% of my time at max. This does *not* pertain to what my minor focuses are.
