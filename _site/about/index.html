  <p>Hello, my name is James. This site is a public-facing log of my professional development. The goal of this site is to log my own growth. For now, my target audience is myself.</p>

  <h3>Format</h3>
  <p>Entries are meant to be representations of what has been studied. The limitations of both the medium (a text-based website) and time prevent in-depth entries. There are few restrictions on myself on <span class="i">what</span> and <span class="i">how</span> I develop.</p>

  <h3>Content</h3>
  <p>Since this log is new, little content is present. Large goals, projects, motifs, are naturally absent. Overtime, this information may present itself here, both for myself, and for others. “<span class="i">Rome wasn't built in a day</span>” the adage goes.</p>

  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>My current profession is designer. Therefore, my primary area of focus covers some aspect of design. I may also work on auxiliary aspects of design (e.g. social sciences, development, product, management).</p>

  <h3>2017 Goals</h3>
  <p>Since this log has started in October 2017, yearly goals are limited.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Record 30 consecutive daily entries</li>
    <li>Complete at least 75 entries by end of year.</li>
    <li>Complete one deep focus.</li>
    <li>Find, and develop a secondary focus.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Colophon</h3>
  <p>Fonts are <span class="i">Oswald</span> and <span class="i">Libre Baskerville</span>. The site is powered by <span class="i">Jekyll</span>, using <span class="i">GitHub Pages</span> as its host. Design and front-end are my own. First created on September 28th, 2017.</p>
