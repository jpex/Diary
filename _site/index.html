<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give the definition to all 125 terms in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> orally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No more than 30 seconds to a term (62 minutes total for the entire deck).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get at least 115/125 terms correct.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>122/125</strong> correct results (97.6%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>41 minutes total time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Incorrect responses to:</p>

<p><em>Mimicry</em>, <em>Interference Effects</em> (gave definition for <em>Expectation Effects</em>), <em>Gutenberg Diagram</em></p>

<h3 id="whats-next-for-upd">What’s next for UPD</h3>

<p>I was surprised that I was able to do this well on the first attempt. I didn’t attempt any ‘cram’ studying for this, just what I’ve documented in this log up to this point. I was a little generous with what a ‘right’ answer is (e.g. mixing up the words ‘recall’ and ‘memory’, ‘method’ and ‘technique’), but not in a way that changed the meaning.</p>

<p>With these results, I mark the end of my first major focus — <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> is complete. As mentioned in previous logs, this will continue to receive passive work via spaced repetition, but won’t be actively worked on beyond that.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-postmortem-to-upd">A Brief Postmortem to UPD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus began: October 10th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Final term added to Anki: December 6th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus ended: December 20th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Number of logged days: 40. There are 72 actual days between Oct 10th and Dec 20th.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a 2+ week hiatus towards the start — no entries between October 13th and November 1st.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am unsure of the total time commitment over those 40 sessions — many were well past 2 hours, some were under 30 minutes. I will take a guess and say the average session time was 90 minutes, or 60 hours of deliberate focus time to UPD.</p>

<p>My primary goal here is process goal, with quality of material learned a secondary goal. Overall, I would have liked for 40 sessions to <em>not</em> be spread out over 72 days, but this is still better than earlier periods of my life. The ratio of logged sessions to days is better if you discount my starting hiatus — 40 for 72 (55%) becomes 36 for 50 (72%), which is slightly above 5 days per 7 day week. This ratio is less important to me for an individual minor focus, but should be set high for cumulative minor focuses, and whatever the major focus of the time is.</p>

<p>In terms quality of material learned, I feel it will be dependent on its ability to synthesize with narrower, more in-depth specialties. For example, will it help me in learning Interaction Design? Visual Design? Research? Will it help me in articulating design to other designers, developers, stakeholders, and/or the general population? The book in of itself is just bullet points to many different ideas — being able to rattle off a definition for <em>accessibility</em> doesn’t make me an expert in the subject.</p>

<h3 id="next-major-focus-tbd">Next major focus: TBD</h3>

<p>I didn’t expect to easily pass my proposed metrics for UPD, and was hoping to delay having to make a decision on my next major focus for a few days. I suspect I will move forward with Visual Design as an umbrella major focus, and keep <em>IxD</em> in the minor slot. I’ll use the upcoming days to research out a general path for visual design, and at least make the commitment to move forward before the year ends.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>25 minute block: Began note taking for book. Through introduction + first third of chapter 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote out notes for pages 8–10. I think Anki can be used for a few terms, and also for some of the figures. Should help in recall of the main stages in the interaction design process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>Read the article <a href="https://medium.com/@matt_yow/the-loyalty-of-images-6629b6a60834">The Loyalty of Images</a>. Kind of a blend of philosophy, linguistics, and semiotics (meaning–making). Coincidentally, my <em>Branding</em> notes today also talked about signifiers.</p>

      December

    <h3 id="upd">UPD</h3>

<p>Studied against 100 cards, 10 of which were new. Done over two 25 minute blocks. There are technically 2 ‘reverse’ cards left.</p>

<p>As I reflect more on this focus, I think achieving a certain ‘score’ on an oral test would be sufficient to close out this focus. In thinking of the term <em>Depth of Processing</em> from this book, I am left to believe that there would be significant diminishing rates of return to continue with the major focus beyond this. With 125 separate terms, most of these terms would be justified with their own books. The nature of this learning acquisition is many superficial connections, and a greater understanding and appreciation for these terms likely means learning more about them elsewhere.</p>

<p>I see <em>UPD</em> being a sort of glue to other ideas and concepts, not the definitive source of knowledge. For example, in the book <em>Branding</em>, I see a phrase ‘MAYA’ (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable), a term I first discovered in <em>UPD</em>. In reading through UX articles on medium, I encounter a lot of references to gestalt psychology, which has several terms scattered in UPD. In the long run, I believe this focus will help me make connections that I may not have made otherwise, but I believe it will be in other works that I acquire a deeper meaning on a subject. With that in mind, <em>UPD</em>’s best offering will be my ability to actively recall terms and definitions, and being able to apply them to explore a concept in more detail.</p>

<p>For immediate goals, I will try to do a full oral test two days from now, with the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I must say the term’s definition out loud, without any writing assistance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am limited to 30 seconds a term (can be auto enforced through Anki).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To pass, I must get at least 115 of 125 (92%) correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I fail overall, I will retake this test every 2 days until I achieve a passing ‘grade’.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When this focus is completed, it does not mean I will stop testing against cards. The rules of space repetition don’t disappear. Overtime, the total time spent on these cards will diminish naturally due to increasing time intervals between completed cards. I will probably cut some terms out as well (e.g. <em>waist-to-hip ratio</em>, <em>hunter-nurturer fixations</em>) that don’t seem worth having active recall for.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Finished reading (last chapter + further reading section) of <em>Branding: A Very Short Introduction</em>.</p>

<p>A nice, condensed book, with a lot of ideas. Feels relevant to today’s world (it was published in the second half of 2017), with terminology, history, approaches, and philosophies described. Being an English publication, I didn’t quite get all the branding examples (as an American), but the point was still made. This book is worth going back for note taking and some memorization. After that, I will probably leave the subject of branding alone for another topic (if not, perhaps pursue something in the ‘further reading’ section).</p>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Read CH1. p. 10–19.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Read CH1. p. 19–27.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday I looked up <em>Interaction Design</em> on wikipedia. Was amusing to see much of the entry’s introduction directly pull from this book’s introduction.</p>

<p>Thought: I may elect to promote <em>IxD</em> to a major focus status instead of visual design. A minor focus on <em>IxD</em> will easily take months, but my current concern is that if little time is dedicated to this subject, I may have to balance accuracy vs speed of understanding in an inefficient way. However, I don’t want my major focus to be perpetually theoretical, which <em>IxD</em> would be in my immediate circumstances. Will see how this plays out — for now I’m in the camp of keeping this a prolonged minor focus.</p>

  <li>No entry for yesterday. Had an unexpected issue to handle for the day.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>UPD:</em> Studied against 100 cards, 20 of which were new. Did over two sessions. The effects of choosing ‘Hard’ over ‘Good’ with these terms is taking effect at this point. There are more cards, but the % of correct answers is closer to 100% now. I am usually answering ‘reverse’ cards — where the definition is presented and I have to recall the term — with ‘Good’.</p>

<h3 id="about-face-the-essentials-of-interaction-design">About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</h3>

<p>For future points, I will simply refer to this focus as <em>IxD</em>.</p>

<p><em>IxD:</em> Completed reading the introduction. Instead of moving on to chapter 1, I have gone back to write out detailed notes from the introduction. The note taking is considerably slower than reading, but I believe essential to acquiring and remembering the content. Am about 2/3rd through the introduction note taking. Will likely use Anki to further reinforce terms and ideas.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Completed note taking of the introduction, began reading chapter 1. Overall, note taking was somewhere between 2–3 times slower than the original re-read. With how much longer a chapter is relative to the introduction, I may move to a format of read half the chapter, take notes on that same half, repeat for the next half chapter.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Read through chapter 7 of the <em>Branding</em> book. There is only 1 chapter left. My ordered approach to this focus vs. <em>IxD</em> is intentional — is one approach better in certain contexts? Here I am reading straight through before going back for note taking. With <em>IxD</em>, I am reading through a chapter, followed by note taking of that chapter. For the uninformed, the length of these books is completely different — I would guess I could read through 8–10 books the length of <em>Branding</em> before I finished <em>IxD</em>. This makes it much more practicable to read through the entire book first before going back for note-taking.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-goals-note-taking-self-testing-meta">Thoughts on goals, note taking, self-testing, meta</h3>

<p>These readings of technical books is considerably slower than if I used the same time allotment to just read through the book, and move on to the next one. With the time I have dedicated to up to this point, I could have easily finished reading Universal Principles of Design, About Face, and Branding already. I have no doubt however that my retention of UPD terms would be close to non-existent if I simply read the book. Based on my own experiences here and from reading other people’s writings, there doesn’t seem to be a substitute for slow, deliberate, and active learning. It seems the strategy for learning as much as possible is more about improving the efficiency of quality learning, rather than improving the quantitative amount of learning.</p>

<p>Goals such as ‘Read <em>X</em> amount of content per week/month/year’, or ‘Read <em>x</em> words per minute’ seem like goals with good deeds that end in a bad outcome. At this time, it feels like process and quality goals are a better approach.</p>

<p>A process goal would be about showing up consistently. The quality of progress wouldn’t matter to the process goal. This idea appears to be the foundation for athleticism and fitness, where showing up to practice at all is the most important aspect to mastery. This is of course not the <em>only</em> factor that matters, more that program quality, coaching, equipment, mean far less if you aren’t consistently applying it. A great barbell strength training program means nothing if you don’t show up to lift.</p>

<p>A quality goal is harder to quantify, and would involve a lot of trial and error. I am a believer in failing, to the extent that I don’t hold quality goals tightly. If I show up to learn (process goal), and try in some way to learn, overtime I should naturally become more efficient in learning new material. My qualitative goals are vague and loosely defined, with the belief that my future self will either solidify such goals, or become better at justifying their vagueness. For now, I hold the goal of qualitative learning that involves repeated exposure to material, using techniques such as spaced repetition and old fashioned note taking to accomplish this. I experiment with specific ideas, such as order of techniques, writing out ideas, typing them out, oral presentation, reading techniques, and writing out my thoughts here. There’s casual research into educational techniques, memory techniques like mnemonic devices, spaced-repetition, and memory palaces.</p>

<p>The value of mentoring and coaching, from the perspective of mastering a subject matter (ignoring the perspective of marketing and connections that could come from those relations), is guiding the student towards a good qualitative path. The prerequisite to these relations being effective is likely in process. Mentorship is wasted if there’s no consistency, and valuable mentors likely avoid students who do not have a strong process.</p>

<p>In my own life reflections, the coach/mentor role has largely been absent. What has also been largely absent is process. I’ve been pretty good at getting by, and when I hit a wall, would either make the minimum adjustments needed to continue, or abandon the situation (both by choice and by force). This has lead me to <em>good enough</em> outcomes, and in many aspects of life, we only need to be good enough. In the situations where we want to master a subject, <em>good enough</em> falls apart. Perhaps my design skills can dazzle the casual observer of design, but that doesn’t make me among the best in the world. Process, combined with time, from the perspective of someone who is not the best at anything, appears to be the cornerstone of becoming a master of a subject. The coach/mentor aspect seems more a byproduct of that labor.</p>

<p>For me, this log as a whole is an attempt at instilling process. It’s publicly–facing nature, as least at the moment, is not for you, the reader of this sentence. It’s for its author, me. It’s public because of the basic social pressure it creates, even if the viewership is imaginary. Perhaps in the future it will gain new users, but it won’t if it fails in creating process.</p>

  <li>UPD: Studied against 50 cards, 20 of which were new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should run out of ‘new’ cards either tomorrow or the next day. After that, I believe what I will do is self-administer an oral exam of the terms, where success depends on a correct % of answers over a certain amount of time. My initial idea with this is a 30 second time limit per term, which amounts to about an hour of rattling of terms (125 terms, 30 seconds a piece).</p>

<h3 id="new-minor-focus-about-face">New Minor Focus: About Face</h3>

<p><em>About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</em> is a new minor focus. Many regard this book as the standard reading on the subject. Without any formal training within interaction design, this would be the logical choice to formalize my understanding.</p>

<p>Given the size of the book, I expect this minor focus, meaning I’m likely to dedicate less than an hour a day to it, to take a few months.</p>

<p>For today, in one 25 minute session, I read through the table of contents, the forward, and 2 pages of the introduction. What I may do is after completing a chapter, I go back to take notes on the subject.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<h3 id="dropping-typography-anatomy">Dropping Typography Anatomy</h3>

<p>Learning typographic anatomy is not of particular interest to me at this time. It feels far too detached from anything useful to me at the moment, with little context or structure being applied. Being a minor focus, one without a great benefit or cost if I failed to learn it now, I would rather focus my attention on other items. Typography will inevitably return to focus, ideally in a situation with better context.</p>

<p>Readers of this, including my future self, could view this as a non-committal move. My current mindset/rationale is that <em>process</em> is more important than <em>goals</em>. I would rather break a commitment if it means preserving the process of learning. The ‘failure’ to complete this focus is learning in of itself — why am I stopping this, were there warning signs I would stop, what can I do to maximize the benefits of my process in the future?</p>

<h3 id="reading-as-a-minor-focus">Reading as a minor focus</h3>

<p>Reading, with subjects loosely held to design, seems to be a logical investment. Recently, I discovered an Oxford series called ‘Very Short Introductions’ for many different subjects. I thought the book <em>Branding</em> in the series would be interesting read, so I’ve decided to pick that up as my current minor focus (and also why I name dropped ‘Oxford’ in this paragraph, so I can associate my reading decisions with an intellegent brand).</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p><em>Branding: A Very Short Introduction</em> is a mere 144 pages. For now, I am reading it straight through. I intended to go back afterwards for notetaking, including the use of Anki.</p>

<p>Started reading today, am currently halfway through it.</p>

    <p>UPD: I configured the Anki deck to show reverse cards now. This effectively doubles the number of cards. Anki naturally limits the number of ‘new’ cards to 20, so today it tested me on the first 20 definitions, in addition to 6 terms like before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typography Anatomy: Tested against 7 older terms. Easier than before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve been thinking out how this site can be more approachable to others. These daily entries are chaos and nuance to virturally everyone. A macro scale of what I am doing would be more presentable. I still consider myself to be the primary user of this log, but there should be a better way to express the general ideas to others.</p>

    <p>Typography: 20 cards. Visual identification is almost instantaneous, while I’ve been falling short on several terms.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Completed the reading of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studied 19 previous UPD terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added 5 new cards to Anki:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card-set-22">Card Set 22</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Veblen Effect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>von Restorff Effect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visuospatial Resonance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wabi-Sabi</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visibility</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty painless. It would seem that going through terms superficially every day leading up to this point was helpful. For example, the term Visuospatial Resonance is described as:</p>

<p><em>“A phenomenon in which an image achieves optimal clarity due to resonance between the spatial frequency of the image and the observer’s distance from the image.”</em></p>

<p>Which I wrote out from memory just now. Repeat exposure to these over the last week seems helpful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completed the final 3 terms. Not sure how the last set is 3, given that I’ve been doing these in sets of 5, and there are 125 terms. An audit of my deck however shows 125 unique terms — this log is probably inaccurate to some degree.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-card-set">Final Card Set</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Waist-to-hip Ratio</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wayfinding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weakest Link</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not much of note.</p>

<h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

<p>Added 5 terms to Anki (with visual examples):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shoulder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serif</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hairline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ligature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finial</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against these + old terms, 16 cards in total.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>Today marks the day I completed my reading of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>, and the ‘learning’ of all 125 terms. This does not mean that UPD is being shut down — spaced repetition’s strength relies on continual reinforcement of what I’ve learned. More importantly, I am unsatisfied with what I have remembered &amp; recalled up to this point.</p>

<p>In the immediate term, I won’t be actively pushing my competency, beyond going back to old terms like I’ve been doing. I will wait at least a few days and figure out a plan of action to conclude this focus. Until then, my immediate interest is expanding the functionality of this log. Type anatomy will continue as is.</p>

    <aside><p><a href="//32/">Entry #32</a></p></aside>
    <p>Added 5 new terms to Anki</p>

<h3 id="card-set-20">Card Set 20</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Symmetry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Threat Detection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stickiness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storytelling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structural Forms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>About average in difficult.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the remaining 13 terms twice. Took about 10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the next 5 set multiple times. Also took the time to look more into the concept of Gestalt Perception, a phrase that has been mentioned in some form many times both in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> and elsewhere. If my next focus is in fact visual design, the Gestalt terms that have been used throughout this focus will likely get a deeper look.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the remaining 13 terms again. The first 5 terms were repeated twice before the 8 other terms were done. At the end, the first 5 terms were typed out again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

<p>Added 5 new terms (and 5 illustrations of the terms) to Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bowl</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Descender</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diagonal Stroke</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ear</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Used Anki as the learning process for these terms. The illustrations were all answered correctly on the first try, while I consistently made mistakes with the terms ‘bowl’ and ‘counter’.</p>

<h3 id="upds-future">UPD’s Future</h3>

<p>This week should be the last time new terms in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> are acquired. This however does not mark the end for UPD learning. At minimum, spaced repetition will continue to happen with these terms, even as I go deep into other things.</p>

<p>At present, I am not satisfied with my ability to recall terms. This is less important in written communication with longer periods of time to think and research, but a significant issue for oral recall. Once all the terms are a part of Anki, I will prolong this deep focus until I am comfortable with recall, with working examples. In practical terms, this likely means self-administered oral exams with time controls. I should also identify which terms are more important to me than others (e.g. terms related to gestalt perception are more relevant than engineering-related terms).</p>

<p>What I might also do is divide out this competency challenge into a future point. For example, a month into a new deep focus, I pause that focus to retest my knowledge for a few days. This I feel plays into the concept of spaced repetition, and to making mental connections between different subjects.</p>
