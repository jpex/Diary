    <h2>
      December 
      15th,
      
      2017
    </h2>

    <aside><p><a href="//41/">Entry #41</a></p></aside>
    <ul>
  <li>No entry for yesterday. Had an unexpected issue to handle for the day.  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>UPD:</em> Studied against 100 cards, 20 of which were new. Did over two sessions. The effects of choosing ‘Hard’ over ‘Good’ with these terms is taking effect at this point. There are more cards, but the % of correct answers is closer to 100% now. I am usually answering ‘reverse’ cards — where the definition is presented and I have to recall the term — with ‘Good’.</p>

<h3 id="about-face-the-essentials-of-interaction-design">About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</h3>

<p>For future points, I will simply refer to this focus as <em>IxD</em>.</p>

<p><em>IxD:</em> Completed reading the introduction. Instead of moving on to chapter 1, I have gone back to write out detailed notes from the introduction. The note taking is considerably slower than reading, but I believe essential to acquiring and remembering the content. Am about 2/3rd through the introduction note taking. Will likely use Anki to further reinforce terms and ideas.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Completed note taking of the introduction, began reading chapter 1. Overall, note taking was somewhere between 2–3 times slower than the original re-read. With how much longer a chapter is relative to the introduction, I may move to a format of read half the chapter, take notes on that same half, repeat for the next half chapter.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Read through chapter 7 of the <em>Branding</em> book. There is only 1 chapter left. My ordered approach to this focus vs. <em>IxD</em> is intentional — is one approach better in certain contexts? Here I am reading straight through before going back for note taking. With <em>IxD</em>, I am reading through a chapter, followed by note taking of that chapter. For the uninformed, the length of these books is completely different — I would guess I could read through 8–10 books the length of <em>Branding</em> before I finished <em>IxD</em>. This makes it much more practicable to read through the entire book first before going back for note-taking.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-goals-note-taking-self-testing-meta">Thoughts on goals, note taking, self-testing, meta</h3>

<p>These readings of technical books is considerably slower than if I used the same time allotment to just read through the book, and move on to the next one. With the time I have dedicated to up to this point, I could have easily finished reading Universal Principles of Design, About Face, and Branding already. I have no doubt however that my retention of UPD terms would be close to non-existent if I simply read the book. Based on my own experiences here and from reading other people’s writings, there doesn’t seem to be a substitute for slow, deliberate, and active learning. It seems the strategy for learning as much as possible is more about improving the efficiency of quality learning, rather than improving the quantitative amount of learning.</p>

<p>Goals such as ‘Read <em>X</em> amount of content per week/month/year’, or ‘Read <em>x</em> words per minute’ seem like goals with good deeds that end in a bad outcome. At this time, it feels like process and quality goals are a better approach.</p>

<p>A process goal would be about showing up consistently. The quality of progress wouldn’t matter to the process goal. This idea appears to be the foundation for athleticism and fitness, where showing up to practice at all is the most important aspect to mastery. This is of course not the <em>only</em> factor that matters, more that program quality, coaching, equipment, mean far less if you aren’t consistently applying it. A great barbell strength training program means nothing if you don’t show up to lift.</p>

<p>A quality goal is harder to quantify, and would involve a lot of trial and error. I am a believer in failing, to the extent that I don’t hold quality goals tightly. If I show up to learn (process goal), and try in some way to learn, overtime I should naturally become more efficient in learning new material. My qualitative goals are vague and loosely defined, with the belief that my future self will either solidify such goals, or become better at justifying their vagueness. For now, I hold the goal of qualitative learning that involves repeated exposure to material, using techniques such as spaced repetition and old fashioned note taking to accomplish this. I experiment with specific ideas, such as order of techniques, writing out ideas, typing them out, oral presentation, reading techniques, and writing out my thoughts here. There’s casual research into educational techniques, memory techniques like mnemonic devices, spaced-repetition, and memory palaces.</p>

<p>The value of mentoring and coaching, from the perspective of mastering a subject matter (ignoring the perspective of marketing and connections that could come from those relations), is guiding the student towards a good qualitative path. The prerequisite to these relations being effective is likely in process. Mentorship is wasted if there’s no consistency, and valuable mentors likely avoid students who do not have a strong process.</p>

<p>In my own life reflections, the coach/mentor role has largely been absent. What has also been largely absent is process. I’ve been pretty good at getting by, and when I hit a wall, would either make the minimum adjustments needed to continue, or abandon the situation (both by choice and by force). This has lead me to <em>good enough</em> outcomes, and in many aspects of life, we only need to be good enough. In the situations where we want to master a subject, <em>good enough</em> falls apart. Perhaps my design skills can dazzle the casual observer of design, but that doesn’t make me among the best in the world. Process, combined with time, from the perspective of someone who is not the best at anything, appears to be the cornerstone of becoming a master of a subject. The coach/mentor aspect seems more a byproduct of that labor.</p>

<p>For me, this log as a whole is an attempt at instilling process. It’s publicly–facing nature, as least at the moment, is not for you, the reader of this sentence. It’s for its author, me. It’s public because of the basic social pressure it creates, even if the viewership is imaginary. Perhaps in the future it will gain new users, but it won’t if it fails in creating process.</p>

    <aside><p><a href="//40/">Entry #40</a></p></aside>
    <ul>
  <li>UPD: Studied against 50 cards, 20 of which were new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should run out of ‘new’ cards either tomorrow or the next day. After that, I believe what I will do is self-administer an oral exam of the terms, where success depends on a correct % of answers over a certain amount of time. My initial idea with this is a 30 second time limit per term, which amounts to about an hour of rattling of terms (125 terms, 30 seconds a piece). </p>

<h3 id="new-minor-focus-about-face">New Minor Focus: About Face</h3>

<p><em>About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</em> is a new minor focus. Many regard this book as the standard reading on the subject. Without any formal training within interaction design, this would be the logical choice to formalize my understanding.</p>

<p>Given the size of the book, I expect this minor focus, meaning I’m likely to dedicate less than an hour a day to it, to take a few months. </p>

<p>For today, in one 25 minute session, I read through the table of contents, the forward, and 2 pages of the introduction. What I may do is after completing a chapter, I go back to take notes on the subject.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Read through the 6th chapter in one 25 minute session. There are only 2 chapters left.</p>

<h3 id="dropping-typography-anatomy">Dropping Typography Anatomy</h3>

<p>Learning typographic anatomy is not of particular interest to me at this time. It feels far too detached from anything useful to me at the moment, with little context or structure being applied. Being a minor focus, one without a great benefit or cost if I failed to learn it now, I would rather focus my attention on other items. Typography will inevitably return to focus, ideally in a situation with better context.</p>

<p>Readers of this, including my future self, could view this as a non-committal move. My current mindset/rationale is that <em>process</em> is more important than <em>goals</em>. I would rather break a commitment if it means preserving the process of learning. The ‘failure’ to complete this focus is learning in of itself — why am I stopping this, were there warning signs I would stop, what can I do to maximize the benefits of my process in the future?</p>

<h3 id="reading-as-a-minor-focus">Reading as a minor focus</h3>

<p>Reading, with subjects loosely held to design, seems to be a logical investment. Recently, I discovered an Oxford series called ‘Very Short Introductions’ for many different subjects. I thought the book <em>Branding</em> in the series would be interesting read, so I’ve decided to pick that up as my current minor focus (and also why I name dropped ‘Oxford’ in this paragraph, so I can associate my reading decisions with an intellegent brand).</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p><em>Branding: A Very Short Introduction</em> is a mere 144 pages. For now, I am reading it straight through. I intended to go back afterwards for notetaking, including the use of Anki.</p>

<p>Started reading today, am currently halfway through it.</p>

  <li>
    <p>UPD: I configured the Anki deck to show reverse cards now. This effectively doubles the number of cards. Anki naturally limits the number of ‘new’ cards to 20, so today it tested me on the first 20 definitions, in addition to 6 terms like before.</p>

    <p>Typography Anatomy: Tested against 7 older terms. Easier than before.</p>

    <p>I’ve been thinking out how this site can be more approachable to others. These daily entries are chaos and nuance to virturally everyone. A macro scale of what I am doing would be more presentable. I still consider myself to be the primary user of this log, but there should be a better way to express the general ideas to others.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Completed the reading of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studied 19 previous UPD terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added 5 new cards to Anki:</p>

  <li>
    <p>Wabi-Sabi</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visibility</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty painless. It would seem that going through terms superficially every day leading up to this point was helpful. For example, the term Visuospatial Resonance is described as:</p>

<p><em>“A phenomenon in which an image achieves optimal clarity due to resonance between the spatial frequency of the image and the observer’s distance from the image.”</em></p>

<p>Which I wrote out from memory just now. Repeat exposure to these over the last week seems helpful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completed the final 3 terms. Not sure how the last set is 3, given that I’ve been doing these in sets of 5, and there are 125 terms. An audit of my deck however shows 125 unique terms — this log is probably inaccurate to some degree.</li>

<p>Not much of note.</p>

<h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

<p>Added 5 terms to Anki (with visual examples):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shoulder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serif</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hairline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ligature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finial</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against these + old terms, 16 cards in total.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>Today marks the day I completed my reading of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>, and the ‘learning’ of all 125 terms. This does not mean that UPD is being shut down — spaced repetition’s strength relies on continual reinforcement of what I’ve learned. More importantly, I am unsatisfied with what I have remembered &amp; recalled up to this point.</p>

<p>In the immediate term, I won’t be actively pushing my competency, beyond going back to old terms like I’ve been doing. I will wait at least a few days and figure out a plan of action to conclude this focus. Until then, my immediate interest is expanding the functionality of this log. Type anatomy will continue as is.</p>

    <p>Added 5 new terms to Anki</p>

<h3 id="card-set-20">Card Set 20</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Symmetry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Threat Detection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stickiness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storytelling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structural Forms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>About average in difficult.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the remaining 13 terms twice. Took about 10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the next 5 set multiple times. Also took the time to look more into the concept of Gestalt Perception, a phrase that has been mentioned in some form many times both in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> and elsewhere. If my next focus is in fact visual design, the Gestalt terms that have been used throughout this focus will likely get a deeper look.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out the remaining 13 terms again. The first 5 terms were repeated twice before the 8 other terms were done. At the end, the first 5 terms were typed out again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

<p>Added 5 new terms (and 5 illustrations of the terms) to Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bowl</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Descender</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diagonal Stroke</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ear</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Used Anki as the learning process for these terms. The illustrations were all answered correctly on the first try, while I consistently made mistakes with the terms ‘bowl’ and ‘counter’.</p>

<h3 id="upds-future">UPD’s Future</h3>

<p>This week should be the last time new terms in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> are acquired. This however does not mark the end for UPD learning. At minimum, spaced repetition will continue to happen with these terms, even as I go deep into other things.</p>

<p>At present, I am not satisfied with my ability to recall terms. This is less important in written communication with longer periods of time to think and research, but a significant issue for oral recall. Once all the terms are a part of Anki, I will prolong this deep focus until I am comfortable with recall, with working examples. In practical terms, this likely means self-administered oral exams with time controls. I should also identify which terms are more important to me than others (e.g. terms related to gestalt perception are more relevant than engineering-related terms).</p>

<p>What I might also do is divide out this competency challenge into a future point. For example, a month into a new deep focus, I pause that focus to retest my knowledge for a few days. This I feel plays into the concept of spaced repetition, and to making mental connections between different subjects.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tested against 19 UPD terms. Decided to label all correct answers as ‘Hard’ instead of ‘Good’. Long term effect would be that these cards will appear sooner, which these terms I feel is important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tested against 2 typography terms. Used ‘Good’ over ‘Hard’.</p>

    <p>Studied against 37 UPD terms. I ran into some very old terms (I’ve been doing these terms alphabetically, these were ‘A’ terms) that I outright forgot, then failed multiple times. Thought it was amusing, and insightful. With Anki, there are 4 ‘reactions’ to answers — again, hard, good, and easy, each impacting how long until the term returns. I’ve been using ‘good’ for most scenarios, sometimes ‘hard’, almost never ‘easy’, and ‘again’ when I get it wrong. As I’ve mentioned in earlier entries, these terms are considerably more wordy than what Anki is typically used for. These old terms make me think I should answer with ‘hard’ instead of ‘good’ for UPD term.</p>

<p>Studied against 5 typography terms — a definition and visual portion.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>Right now I am thinking that after the <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> deep focus is complete, that I do something akin to a major/minor setup. What I have in mind is a major/deep focus on Visual Design, and a minor focus on Interaction Design. I don’t think the visual design focus needs to be made more specific at the high level, it would encompass a lot of subcategories (typography, color, iconography, logos, graphic design, etc.). Unlike what I’ve done up to this point, this deep focus would be  primarily practical execution with a little bit of theory — you can’t really get good at visualizations without a lot of actual practice.</p>

<p>The minor focus on interaction design would be via the book <em>About Face</em>, and unless the book pushes for practical examples, would be similar to the UPD focus.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>Need to expand out functionality of this log. Right now this site just dumps every single post, which has a few different problems. I’d like to be able to write up longer, more organized pieces, which this current system can’t handle. May start iterating this platform.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Studied against 32 existing cards. Had a historically consistent correct percent of around 85%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studied against a new card set.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card-set-19">Card Set 19</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Self-Similarity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serial Position Effects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shaping</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Was relatively painless — less than 15 minutes, including entry into Anki.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read more in-depth to the above set of terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>20 minute block: Typed out the remaining 18 cards. At this point, I am starting to confuse which terms I’ve recently finished and which terms remain. I consider this a good thing, as when I learn them doesn’t have much bearing in their practical application in the future (e.g. Did I learn similarity before scarcity? Does this matter? No.). Outside of a single complex term — Visuospatial Resonance — it seems like the remaining terms should be painless to learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>20 minute block: Repeat above practice. Done over an hour apart.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introducing-a-light-focus-typography-anatomy">Introducing a light focus: Typography Anatomy</h3>

<p>At this point, I feel comfortable with the rate that <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> is moving, and how it has been going. The time efficiency of these terms as improved, leaving me with more time to do other things. I could use that time to learn UPD at an accelerated rate, or make deeper connections with existing terms, but I would rather not. Those things will come in time, there is no need to accelerate this.</p>

<p>Instead, I believe it is more valuable to study something closely related, but distinctly different from this. Based on my understanding of how the act of learning works, oscillating between subjects can bridge connections between the subjects.</p>

<p>I chose typography anatomy/terminology for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It has been on my mind for the last few days.</li>
  <li>An opportunity to use Anki in a theoretically more efficient way. Anki is a tool commonly used by medical and foreign language students. This kind of typography learning resembles basic terminology and visualizations better than the more abstract terms in UPD.</li>
  <li>If I want to move on to another focus, or dive deeper into typography, this subject is easy to modify to reflect this desire.</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding of typography terms is already there to some degree, to the point that this focus will not much external structure. What I am doing right now is taking type terms from <a href="http://typedia.com/learn/only/anatomy-of-a-typeface/">Typedia</a> and <a href="https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary">Typography Deconstructed</a> and forming terms worth learning.</p>

<p>For today, I created five terms. For each term, I also ripped the visual example in Typography Deconstructed and they also have a card. The five terms today were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Aperture (using <a href="https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary/aperture">this</a> as the visual example in one card)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apex (same as above, and all following cards)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ascender</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baseline</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These terms were substantially easier to remember and recall than UPD terms. This makes sense since they are all more simple concepts.</p>

<p>For this focus, I expect that at the very least I exhaust all the terms mentioned in Typedia, with working visual examples of each. I may try and find a way to deconstruct the anatomy of text in more complex and written ways in the future.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Studied against 14 existing cards. Despite an increasing number of cards, these cards aren’t piling up (assuming that they are tackled daily and not skipped). Took 20 minutes (3 errors, also decided to type out each one twice, once before an answer reveal, and once after).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Studied against a new card set.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card-set-18">Card Set 18</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rule of Thirds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Satisficing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Savanna Preference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scaling Fallacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scarcity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Was pretty painless in terms of difficult and time. Given that I did go through these cards yesterday (along with all the remaining terms), there was a sense of déjà vu here. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Readining through the above 5 terms. No notes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Typed out the remaining 23 terms twice. Did the same yesterday with the remaining 28. A lot of it felt familiar, just not to the point where I knew all the terms ahead of time. Will be interesting to see if this block really does bring down the time to learning their terms — it seems card set 18 was easy, but that could just be a coincidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Repeated above block. Was done about an hour apart.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This format feels pretty stable in terms of being meaningful. Will continue to use it. </p>
