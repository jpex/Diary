    <p>Studied against 10 old cards. The ones from the 4th deck were largely here, which I struggled to get through again.</p>

<p>Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:</p>

<h3 id="card-set-7">Card Set 7</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Feedback Loop</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expection Effect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exposure Effect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factors of Safety</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against, took about 20 minutes. Towards the more difficult of sets to learn. Possibly because the terms to most of them are long.</p>

    <p>Studied against 20 cards. Took a little less than 25 minutes. Most mistakes were made in more recent cards. Partial explaination could be skipping yesterday caused a disruption in spaced learning. The ones that were missed were not major mistakes, however.</p>

<p>Given a large time slot, I decided to skim through the remaining 95 design principles (125 total, 30 currently committed). At minimum, the term, definition, and examples were read. For many, some of the paragraph text was read. For a few, the entirety was read. There is no reason to believe all these terms are memorized, but in theory, it will be easier to develop recall abilities of these future terms. Time alloted to this: approximentaly 4 hours, over a 5 hour total time slot.</p>

    <p>Studied against all existing anki cards. Time: 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:</p>

<h3 id="card-set-5">Card Set 5</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defensible Space</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convergence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depth of Processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost-Benefits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to testing against defintions, I wrote down the terms, followed by reading the indepth of each card. The actual test against the 5 cards took 25 minutes before I could recite each.</p>

<h3 id="observation-of-processing">Observation of processing</h3>

<p>This particular studying took a little less time than others. What jumps out however is the ease of the time felt much less mentally taxing than previous attempts at learning new card sets. Coincidentally, one of the terms, depth of processing, states that information is better recalled when its content are deeply analyzed. In this particular learning acquisition, I read through the inforamtion prior to using anki to memorize the terms. There could be other reasons for why this particular session was easier and faster than others (less tired, naturally easier terms, better environment, etc.), but there is reason to believe I would have a better time acquiring new information if I take a deeper dive into each piece of information first. Will try this on the 6th card set.</p>

<h3 id="continuation-within-the-same-day">Continuation within the same day</h3>

<p>Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:</p>

<h3 id="card-set-6">Card Set 6</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Design by committee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Desire Line</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development Cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entry Point</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Errors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For these terms, I went through this process before committing the cards to Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read all 5 definitions, followed by writing out all 5 definitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the page on each individual term. Wrote the definition again. At a new entry, I would go back and rewrite the definition of a prior term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped each principle and definition at least 3 times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waited ~10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped each principle, followed by attempting to retype each term from memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added each term to Anki.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waited ~10 minutes, tested against Anki. No incorrect answers, repeated each term twice. Took 7 minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since this is all in the shortrun, I wouldn’t have all these terms locked down in memory. However, this basic approach felt like the easiest and most enjoyable of anki card sets. Will attempt this more.</p>

    <p>Studied against first 3 anki card decks. Took under 20 minutes (last session a few days ago took over 45 minutes with the same set).</p>

<p>Added 4th deck to anki. Tested against it. 5 new cards took over 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<h3 id="commentary-on-the-anki-decks-up-to-this-point">Commentary on the anki decks up to this point</h3>

<p>This is my first attempt at utilizing anki to learn new material. It certainly seems that the initial learning of terms if by far the most difficult and time consuming aspect of this process, while returning back to cards is relatively quick and easy (assuming I have been faithfull following the process and not missing large chunks of time). While unspurprising, the degree to which it is true, is. In addition, the ability to recall exactly what knowledge I’ve acquired seems limiting at the moment. Likely, I will need new routes of learning the same material to be able to really tap into the knowledge being acquired. Unfortunately, this particular book has a tendency to use examples that are pretty outdated (TiVo, pre-smart phone Nokias, early 00’s GUIs). Cross connecting these terms, and building up working examples of the terms, I suspect will help here.</p>

    <p>Retested against existing anki cards.</p>

<p>Overall, have been struggling with recalling the terms. The memories of the examples seem to be tied to specific phrasing of terms, and take a long time to parse out the answer. Perhaps it’s just that basic terms can be hard to give a clear defintion to—can you say what “alignment” really means? What about a “comparison”?</p>

<p>More practice, time, and different kinds of exposure is likely the solution to these.</p>

    <p>Two week haitus in practice for UPD. Unfortunate, but I continue on.</p>

<p>Tested against Anki flash cards of design principles already covered. Bad spaced repitition here resulted in a sluggish performance. Will need to be retested here, and read through the details of these principles again before introducing new design principles.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>In the haitus, there was a significant amount of portfolio work completed.</p>
