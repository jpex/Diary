    <p>Studied against 26 existing cards. For this test, I spoke out the term before writing the term in full. The process of recalling some terms outloud felt weird – I would say the term correctly, and it probably doesn’t sound that weird, but I felt like I was searching for a specific string of words in my head to say. For others, I would try and parse out the definition’s entire phrase before starting to speak it. For one I confidentally said aloud the term and then wrote it down, only to discover I defined a completely different term. There were a few where I forgot the phrasing of the term and improvised. They were somewhat accurate, but not good enough.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Learning the 12th set of terms. For this particular set of terms, I decided to incorporate an additional strategy of associating the terms with visual references and mnemonic devices. Unsure of how well it will work in future attempts. As an example: the term legibility has five listed properties, the acronym of them being CSSTT. This is largely nonsense, until you combine the two T’s, and suddenly you have: CSS PI (CSS π, CSS 3.14). Assuming I can remember a random phrase like CSS PIE, I can remember the 5 general properties is contrast, size, spacing, text block, and typeface.</p>

<p>While I feel I can recall a lot of these terms with some accuracy, I find the processing time to be pretty limiting. I think before I move onto another deep focus, I will need to reinforce these terms and their meanings through other methods. Given the information is already there to some degree, this process should be considerably faster.</p>

<p>Ideally I think, if these made up visualizations I have of card set 12 hold up to memory, I may go back and apply them to all terms. In addition to, have at least one working example of every single principle (this book conveniently provides such a thing), and related terms to other terms.</p>

<p>More other: Originally was going to spend most of the day on this focus, but instead prioritized my design portfolio today.</p>

    <p>Tried a new technique — over a 25 minute period, I wrote out as many defintions as I could of upcoming terms. At the halfway mark, instead of continuing, I restarted with the same terms I already wrote, repeating each term twice in the second round (totaling 3 writes). This 25 minute block got me to write 17 terms 3 times. This technique may help with learning by exposing myself to future terms multiple times before I’m obliged to learn them.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>As I approach the half way point of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>, the date for a new deep focus topic is approaching. Originally, I planned on deep diving into <em>About Face</em> by Alan Cooper first, but went with UPD instead because of an easy adoption to Anki, which is also an experiment here.</p>

<p>There are a few potential deep dive routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>About Face (Interaction Design)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google, Apple (, and maybe Microsoft)’s design guidelines, including the reproduction of various UI elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Animation (in general)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Adobe program such as XD, Illustrator, and/or After Effects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphic Design (Theory)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many different choices. What I may do is try and do a main dive into a field, and have a minor dive in one or two areas concurrently. I forsee something that blends theoretical and practical application.</p>

<p>Tested against in Anki. Took 6 minutes (compared to ~20–30 minutes of most first time tests). It could be false sense of accomplishment via short term memory, but these particular terms felt very easy to learn. I definitely remember the examples from when I went ahead and read through the remainder of this book. In any case, this <em>should</em> be a straightforward set to remember (we’ll see tomorrow).</p>

<h3 id="other-reading">Other Reading</h3>

<p>Read an article on opitcal effects in user interfaces:</p>

<p>https://medium.muz.li/optical-effects-9fca82b4cd9a</p>

<p>The information here is useful. At a future point, it may be useful to me to formalize how to describe these illusions. In the event I do a deep dive into icon design or typography, this should become even more important.</p>

<p>Tested against, took about 20 minutes. Towards the more difficult of sets to learn. Possibly because the terms to most of them are long.</p>

<p>Continued on reading for the 8th card set. Read each indepth, wrote out terms. Will add to, and test with, Anki in the next session.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>Day streaks are now apart of this page. This ended up being much more tedious to do than anticipated, largely because most of it is done using the liquid templating system, instead of a “real” programming language. Fun in some ways, but also reminds me why I prefer design to development.</p>

    <p>Studied against 20 cards. Took a little less than 25 minutes. Most mistakes were made in more recent cards. Partial explaination could be skipping yesterday caused a disruption in spaced learning. The ones that were missed were not major mistakes, however.</p>

<p>Given a large time slot, I decided to skim through the remaining 95 design principles (125 total, 30 currently committed). At minimum, the term, definition, and examples were read. For many, some of the paragraph text was read. For a few, the entirety was read. There is no reason to believe all these terms are memorized, but in theory, it will be easier to develop recall abilities of these future terms. Time alloted to this: approximentaly 4 hours, over a 5 hour total time slot.</p>

    <p>Studied against all existing anki cards. Time: 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:</p>

<h3 id="card-set-5">Card Set 5</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defensible Space</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convergence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depth of Processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost-Benefits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to testing against defintions, I wrote down the terms, followed by reading the indepth of each card. The actual test against the 5 cards took 25 minutes before I could recite each.</p>

<h3 id="observation-of-processing">Observation of processing</h3>

<p>This particular studying took a little less time than others. What jumps out however is the ease of the time felt much less mentally taxing than previous attempts at learning new card sets. Coincidentally, one of the terms, depth of processing, states that information is better recalled when its content are deeply analyzed. In this particular learning acquisition, I read through the inforamtion prior to using anki to memorize the terms. There could be other reasons for why this particular session was easier and faster than others (less tired, naturally easier terms, better environment, etc.), but there is reason to believe I would have a better time acquiring new information if I take a deeper dive into each piece of information first. Will try this on the 6th card set.</p>

<h3 id="continuation-within-the-same-day">Continuation within the same day</h3>

<p>Created 5 anki cards for the following design principles:</p>

<h3 id="card-set-6">Card Set 6</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Design by committee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Desire Line</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development Cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entry Point</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Errors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For these terms, I went through this process before committing the cards to Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read all 5 definitions, followed by writing out all 5 definitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the page on each individual term. Wrote the definition again. At a new entry, I would go back and rewrite the definition of a prior term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped each principle and definition at least 3 times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waited ~10 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped each principle, followed by attempting to retype each term from memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added each term to Anki.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waited ~10 minutes, tested against Anki. No incorrect answers, repeated each term twice. Took 7 minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since this is all in the shortrun, I wouldn’t have all these terms locked down in memory. However, this basic approach felt like the easiest and most enjoyable of anki card sets. Will attempt this more.</p>

<p>Added 4th deck to anki. Tested against it. 5 new cards took over 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<h3 id="commentary-on-the-anki-decks-up-to-this-point">Commentary on the anki decks up to this point</h3>

<p>This is my first attempt at utilizing anki to learn new material. It certainly seems that the initial learning of terms if by far the most difficult and time consuming aspect of this process, while returning back to cards is relatively quick and easy (assuming I have been faithfull following the process and not missing large chunks of time). While unspurprising, the degree to which it is true, is. In addition, the ability to recall exactly what knowledge I’ve acquired seems limiting at the moment. Likely, I will need new routes of learning the same material to be able to really tap into the knowledge being acquired. Unfortunately, this particular book has a tendency to use examples that are pretty outdated (TiVo, pre-smart phone Nokias, early 00’s GUIs). Cross connecting these terms, and building up working examples of the terms, I suspect will help here.</p>

    <p>Retested against existing anki cards.</p>

<p>Overall, have been struggling with recalling the terms. The memories of the examples seem to be tied to specific phrasing of terms, and take a long time to parse out the answer. Perhaps it’s just that basic terms can be hard to give a clear defintion to—can you say what “alignment” really means? What about a “comparison”?</p>

<p>More practice, time, and different kinds of exposure is likely the solution to these.</p>

    <p>Two week haitus in practice for UPD. Unfortunate, but I continue on.</p>

<p>Tested against Anki flash cards of design principles already covered. Bad spaced repitition here resulted in a sluggish performance. Will need to be retested here, and read through the details of these principles again before introducing new design principles.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>In the haitus, there was a significant amount of portfolio work completed.</p>
