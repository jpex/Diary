<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforced learning: Tested against 8 cards. All correct answers (I believe this is a first for IxD).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finished out typing the last notes for Chapter 1. The total word count of the Introduction + Chapter 1 in my notes is 4,767 words. Went back and typed out the last subsection later on (notes on the notes).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For this final subsection, I feel like this content is jargon-heavy. This is not to say the content is worthwhile, but there is a part of me that feels that heavy Anki usage here might be an inefficient use of my time. I have read a general criticism of this book a few times now: that this book is (ironically) difficult to parse and too verbose. For example, the definition of ‘Interaction Design’ includes both the words ‘interaction’ and ‘design’, which I think is silly.</p>

<p>A part of me understands the inforamtion well: I know what a ‘user interview’ is, and it being an activity in ‘Research’ makes sense to me. Some of it though, such as ‘Defining manifestations of information and functionality’ as an activity in the ‘Design Framework’ portion means nothing to me, and trying to memorize that phrase now doesn’t help me understand it. <em>Maybe</em> it helps me several chapters from now, but it will also slow me down in getting there.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the detailed view of the Goal-Directed Design process won’t really be something to comprehend until the details are unearthed in later chapters. This goes in conflict of what I’ve been suggesting for a few days, but I’ve only now read it. I think one of my ‘goals’ for this book then will be to explain this process in a simpler way than the book.</p>

<p>Added 8 new cards to Anki</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two reasons to include designers in the research process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six phases of Goal-Directed Design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Research</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Modeling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Requirements Definition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Framework Definition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Design Refinement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goal-Directed Design Process: Design Support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not a whole lot of issue here. The 6 process terms are very simple. I don’t think it’s worth pressing the issue with deeper phrasing of these 6 processes, and just try to synthesize a better understanding from the following chapters.</p>

<p>I do some casual reading (i.e. reading without deep interaction with the material) bit by bit. I’ve made my next book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X">Mastery</a></em> by Robert Greene (the book I just finished was a biography on Eisenhower). Years ago I got through half of his book <em>48 Laws of Power</em>, and I remember I liked the book style (don’t remember why I stopped). As the book’s content is related to professional work, I’d thought I’d mention it in a log.</p>

<p><em>Universal Principles of Design</em> already had a comprehensive definition for <em>mental model</em>, so I pulled that in for this. As expected, that term had no issue. Did not have large issues with these new terms.</p>

<p>As mentioned in earlier logs, there is one last section of Chapter 1, but will take much longer to complete than these other sections. Won’t move on to Chapter 2 until I feel I have the entire Goal-Directed design process overview down in memory.</p>

    <h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<p><strong>Reinforced Learning:</strong> Tested against 5 existing cards. Two minor errors. Retyped out the two chapter subsections from yesterday.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typed out notes for Chapter 1’s subsection <em>Implementaiton Models and Mental Models</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Created 5 Anki cards for Chapter’1 subsection <em>Recognizing User Goals</em>, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Both activites and tasks are…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hierarchy of Activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Activity Theory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Activities and tasks are transient, because…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to users, it’s the designer’s job to (2)…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against these cards, with only minor difficulties. For this one, I typed out the terms and definitions many times over before doing the actual test of them.</p>

<p>I think this chapter subsection approach is making sense. Not all subsections are created equal, but a good general format for learning the material might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforced learning of old terms, and retyping out notes from subsection <em>x</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyping out notes from subsection <em>y</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typing out new notes from subsection <em>z</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going back to subsection <em>y</em> and extracting out potential cards to create and test.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And repeat when complete. The time between each ‘task’ here (to borrow phrasing from this book) would naturally vary based on a subsection’s material. For example, many of the subsections in Chapter 1 might need less than 5 Anki cards, but the last subsection of chapter 1, which gives a detailed overview of the entire focus of chapters 2–6, might take many days to get through.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update: Attempted to type out the notes for the final subsection, <em>An Overview of Goal-Directed Design</em>. It’s possible this subsection is the single most important subsection in this book. Being able to recall this particular information would be critical to being able to describe the entire design process on a high level, and in theory, will make the next 5 chapters much easier to process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>UPD</em>: Tested against 9 cards. 1 incorrect (did not accept ‘phenomenon’ as a substitute for ‘property’ in a definition).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Branding</em>: Tested against 3 cards. No issues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tested against 11 Anki cards. A few minor issues, but relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel this minor focus has run its course. There are a few reasons for this: the biggest being that the opportunity cost of continuing this over a different focus has become too great. Others include: the ‘need’ to dive deeper into branding is not present, most of what is worth reinforcing form this book is towards the beginning, and that I am effectively dragging my feet on this focus.</p>

<p>With a complete read, notes on the main focus of the book, and Anki cards set up for this, I consider this minor focus complete. All future logs of this study will be in the <em>reinforced learning</em> section.</p>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tested against 12 Anki cards. Funny enough (or maybe worryingly), I got the term ‘Design’ wrong multiple times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped out Chapter 1 subsection’s notes from <em>Planning and Designing Product Behavior</em> and <em>Recognizing User Goals</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From <em>Planning and Designing Product Behavior</em>, I created cards for the following concepts:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall Product Success is made from (3): [Two cards]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A successful product is <strong>__, __</strong>, and <em>__</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against these 3 new cards. Went over pretty well. A part of me wants to continue to add more terms here for the next subsection, but experience tells me to be patient.</p>

<p><strong>IxD Direction</strong></p>

<p>Based on my current professional situation, and in going through this book, it is clear to me that this book needs deliberate focus, with its material immediately relevant to me. This is ultimately the main reason for marking <em>Branding</em> as complete instead of pushing on with it.</p>

<p><em>About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</em> will become the <em>de facto</em> major focus. When my private professional focus has been taken care of, I can evaluate what to do with the major focus slot.</p>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>UPD</em>: Tested against 41 cards. One incorrect term.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this log would be helpful to myself and others if I included a weekly and monthly report. This is a feature I’ve noticed in the <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journal</a> world, and would be useful in evaulating what I’ve accomplished on a larger time scale. The current design of this blog only supports a daily format, so I would either need to utilize the same format, or have a separated out section for longer time scale entries. I think the latter is ideal in the long-run. This will probably be something I build out slowly over this month.</p>

<p>Read the article <a href="https://shift.newco.co/hard-and-soft-skills-in-tech-8be00216f67f">Hard and Soft Skills in Tech</a>. Was an encourging read on the managerial needs of a tech team.</p>

<p>There was a specific use case for this — I wanted an easy to build a responsive, simple flowchart that I can easily customize.</p>

<p>I tried out some elaborate ul li hierarchies originally, but creating relationships within them (things like last-child, nth-child, etc.) ending up being a mini-nightmare. Turns out good old div’s and an elaborate flex layout makes this kind of layout a lot easier. This can be customized to some degree (for example, the “generation”/columns don’t have to line up). For my use case, I limited this to just a grandchild “generation”, but I’m sure this could be expanded out to <em>n</em> generations.</p>

<h3 id="animationcode">Animation/Code</h3>

<p>Made: https://codepen.io/jpex/pen/jYBpzw</p>

<p>Turns out this only runs well in Firefox. The icons in the color circles are from font awesome, otherwise the rest of the code was made within codepen.</p>

<p>After trying to code this up, and through my deep reading of <em>About Face</em>, I feel like I have a better understanding for why I prefer design to development (or maybe, I’m just relearning a lesson over 3 years ago when I was ‘trapped’ as a front-end developer). Code seems to only be interesting to me if it’s a direct result of my own design. It seems that the moment the code is no longer about <em>me</em>, my interest in development ends. It’s plausible if I ever got into non-UI development that I’d think otherwise, but then again, I was never interested in that because there wasn’t human interaction in the work.</p>

<p>This exercise does make me wonder how more “true” UI developers code out these effects, and also how they collaborate with designers to execute it. I remember in the past having to try and code out complex animations where the only direction from design was to ‘copy’ a style from site <em>x</em> (hello Squarespace). I ponder why it’s acceptable for myself to reverse engineer some elaborate scrolling animation on a different site, but design couldn’t do their own animation in a graphics program and show exactly what they wanted, with their own design artifacts.</p>

<p>I guess the point of this ramble is to just learn After Effects. Or Framer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Retyping out notes from the intro + half of first chapter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 minute block: Went through all of my note to date to find cards I could create in Anki.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Created 11 cards in Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Brands can <strong>__ __</strong> and <strong>__ __</strong> in shopping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signifier</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brands have helped us sensitize ourselves to the interplay of <strong>__ and __</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>INSIDER view of what a brand is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OUTSIDER view of what a brand is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A brand is (by book’s definition)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>__</em> brand has a brand name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>__</em> brands have a logo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brand Identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Breakdown of brand definition (3 parts).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some cards are (clearly) more difficult than others, which is fine. The most important cards would relate to signifier, signified, and the simplified + breakdown definition of ‘brand’.</p>

<p>For signifier and signified, I looked at the book’s definition, along with online definitions. I used Oxford’s online terms for each in Anki.</p>

<p>Oxford describes them as such:</p>

<p><strong>Signified:</strong>
The meaning or idea expressed by a sign, as distinct from the physical form in which it is expressed.</p>

<p><strong>Signifier:</strong>
A sign’s physical form (such as a sound, printed word, or image) as distinct from its meaning.</p>

<p>I found these terms somewhat confusing, and after digging more into the meaning behind the words, I decided to arrange the wording of the definitions to make them easier to work with. Not something I’ve really done up this point (and why I’m describing it here).</p>

<p><strong>Signified:</strong>
A sign’s expression of its idea or meaning, as distinct from a sign’s physical form.</p>

<p><strong>Signifier:</strong>
A sign’s physical form — such as a sound, printed word, or image — as distinct from its meaning.</p>

<p>Changing the wording around for <em>signified</em> in my mind helped me understand not only its meaning better, but how it compares to <em>signifier</em>. Since the two words are so related to each other, it makes sense to word their definitions to make it easier to process them together.</p>

<p>Parsing out these terms, adding them into Anki, refining the definitions during testing, and testing against the cards themselves, took about an hour.</p>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>25 minute block: Retyping out notes from the first half of Chapter 1. Got between 1/2 and 2/3rd through before I ran out of</li>
  <li>One hour block: Identified and added more cards for Anki.</li>
</ul>

<p>6 new anki cards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Four main steps to designing interactive systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four main reasons why a digital product fails</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed definition of human-oriented design activities (broken down into 3 cards)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tested against these as well.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve started to do these deep repeats within <em>About Face</em>, I think I will adjust my advancement strategy. Since these chapters of content are so dense, I think it makes sense to stop at the end of each of their “h2”s (don’t know what you call them for a book) and extracting out as much information as possible. My current strategy was to go through the first half of one chapter (and the strategy before that was the entire chapter). Other segments of my time can be focused on reinforced learning (i.e. going back to the previous “h2” area) and just reading through the next “h2”. This book’s formatting is sufficient for this approach.</p>

  <li><em>UPD:</em> 14 anki cards to test against. 13 were right (the one I got wrong was <em>color</em>. There were 4 general uses for color, I could only remember 3 of them).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dropping-my-major-focus">Dropping my major focus</h3>

<p>Something that has been on my mind, but I haven’t decided until today — I am in need of vacating my major focus. To be more specific, I am in need of that major focus time for other professional involvements. The logic being along the lines of: visual design is important to me, but not time urgent. On the other hand, I need to take care of a long term project that is important to me, <em>and</em> is time urgent. Logically, the urgent one takes priority in a world of important things.</p>

<p>While professional in nature, I choose not to disclose it in this log — it is a private, rather than public, affair. The minor focuses will continue, as they are still relevant.</p>

    <p>Wanted to spend the day pushing forward my two minor focuses. They aren’t making enough progress for my liking, but also I want to continue to churn over thoughts about the major focus.</p>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tested against 3 existing cards. Got all 3 right (a few days ago, these cards took 5+ retries to get).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Retyped out my introduction notes. Was able to type from memory the Anki cards I pulled from my notes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typed out my initial written notes for Chapter 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continued to type out notes for Chapter 1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m surprised at how slow this is. I don’t feel like I’m moving slow, rather this is dense material. Going back and typing these notes, I don’t remember a lot of these details from the first reading. Given that this is the introduction to the main method prescribed by this book, it would be foolish to push through this content faster. I do wonder if I will be able to move through future content faster.</p>

<p>For context, I have 16 pages worth of notes in Google Docs (a very liberal use of white space to be fair) for just the first half of chapter 1. I’ve spent maybe 3 hours in note taking just for that first half of one chapter. Naturally, this content will also need to be repeated many times over, and will only add more time to this. I have to wonder if I should allocate more time to this book.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Finished note taking for chapter 1. Retyped out the notes from the chapter.</p>

<p>Typed out notes for about 2/3rd of chapter 2.</p>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>UPD</em>: 11 terms over 7 minutes (semi-distracted). No issues. Most of the cards I got correct had 7+ days before they’d be seen again.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it-fe7a132f4430">Net Promoter Score Considered Harmful</a> (and What UX Professionals Can Do About It) by Jared Spool. Was an interesting read on a KPI that I haven’t had experience using. <em>Update:</em> I originally found this on Medium. When going to Spool’s twitter, I found a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16003514">hacker news</a> posting for it, which included responses from Spool himself. Very useful to run into responses to articles like this. Is interesting how much better a place like Hacker News (or reddit) <em>can</em> be about discussions vs. Medium, and especially vs. Twitter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Found an interesting source of material yesterday night — <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed">The Encylopedia of Human Computer Interaction</a>. It begins with a testiomy from Don Norman, a character that I have already ran into a few times in <em>About Face</em>. It’s free, and appears to be quite expansive in content. With how large <em>About Face</em> seems though, I would be quite hesistant for any degree of focus to be dedicated to this material (for now).</p>

<p>Today I’ve thought about redefining this major focus. I still haven’t really determined a sense of direction for this, and don’t feel like I’m going to find one either.</p>

<p>Practical application of design however remains a top priority of mine. I think I ought to expand the scope of the focus. This is only something I’ve definitively felt today, so I’ll let this idea sit in my head for a little while before doing so.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>Retyped out of my notes.</p>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<p>Studied against all 6 cards. Much better than 2 days ago. Was strict with answers (e.g. using ‘use the ___’ instead of ‘interact with the __’ was marked wrong).</p>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

<p>Tested against 32 <em>UPD</em> terms. 31/32 correct. Total number of cards higher due to skipping yesterday.</p>

<p>Explored general ergonomics for creating visualizations. I have an iPad Pro + Pencil, and wanted to try and find a way to use it. A lot of the native apps seem to be geared towards art creation. I did get the app <em>Duet Display</em>, which lets the iPad act as a second monitor. This method is probably limiting, as there is no way to have a ‘hover’ state with the iPad combo.</p>

<p>Refound a skillshare by Adam Whitcroft called <a href="http://skl.sh/adamw">Icon Design: Create a Cohesive Icon Set</a>. It’s a few years old, but should be fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Typed</em> out my current notes. Was significantly faster than my original writing — had enough time to write them all out, then continue to type out new notes within chapter 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<p>Re-typed out my notes from the introduction, and did it again.</p>

<p>Added 6 cards to Anki:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interaction Design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘UX has three overlapping concerns…’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Interaction Design is concerned with…’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design Principles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design Patterns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Design Process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Was destroyed by those terms in testing. I haven’t been so consistently wrong with quizzing since the first third of <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> (the book got easier overtime once I started going through future terms superficially on a regular basis). I ended up spending much more time with <em>About Face</em> then I intended, as I didn’t expect to spend 45 minutes testing against 6 cards (in addition to adding the cards into the system, a quick pre-study of the terms, and typing out the intro notes twice).</p>

<p>While frustrating to go through, it does reinforce the idea in my head that I should approach this book slowly in terms of general progression, how much like how <em>UPD</em> was.</p>

<h3 id="visual-design">Visual Design</h3>

<p>Briefly went through some interesting framework articles from <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/@priyanka_godbole">Priyanka Godbole</a>. Topics include web color, spacing, and type systems.</p>

<p>Acquired Adobe Illustrator.  I went through some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgmu8RwLi28">a tutorial on Illustrator</a>. The mechanics remind me a bit of Photoshop and Sketch, leading me to believe I should be fine with the application itself. Actual execution is of course still up in the air.</p>

<p>The immediate issue I ran into was how physically awkward it is to use a graphics editor program. Pen tools are particularly bad. This machine, a Macbook, only has the mouse in the center.</p>

<p>This dexterity challenge in the physical interaction with a computer is perpetual for me, and maybe why I didn’t really dive into digital illustrations 10+ years ago. I’m left handed, and am entirely conditioned to use my right hand for a mouse. Using my left hand for a navigation system feels awkward, when it really shouldn’t. For most computer tasks, using my right hand is a non-issue. It’s when pinpoint percision with smooth movement comes into the play that it feels physically impossible to express good movement — I’m not right handed, I have no experience in using my left hand, a mouse itself is generally regarded as inferior to a tablet pen in this case, and a mostly untrained artistic capacity.</p>

<p>On further reflection, I wouldn’t be surprised if this is limiting me in other programs like PS and Sketch. After a short period of time with Sketch, I became more comfortable with it than PS, despite having many more years experience with PS. There is a natural argument to made about the UX/product philosophy of the programs itself, but one important difference with my Sketch workflow is how quick I am to entering in numerical values into dialogue boxes (aka a lot of keyboard control). Sketch just felt easier to do that, and now I wonder if part of my preference for it has to do with this awkwardness with precision. This will be an interesting topic to reflect on — whether or not part of my own sub-design interests have been influenced by how well I can physically interact with a computer.</p>

<p>Either way, I will need to do more research into figuring out a best path forward with this. If I’m going to do any kind of illustrations, it’s logical to want to use my dominant hand.</p>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

  <li><em>UPD</em>: 13 cards over 7 minutes. All correct.</li>

<p><strong>Isometric squares in CSS/HTML:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr">https://codepen.io/jpex/full/YYGyMr</a></p>

<p>I ran into an article in the morning on creating isometric effects in illustrations. Titled, <a href="https://design.zeta.in/how-i-became-an-illustrator-by-discovering-a-new-dimension-1dbc99bba7a5">How I became an Illustrator by discovering a new dimension</a>, I thought it would be interesting to try off part of the technique.</p>

<p>I decided to try out the technique using HTML &amp; CSS. It was curiosity as to whether or not the technique would easily translate into CSS. It worked well (at least in this isolated environment), and from there just dived into playing around with the effects within CSS.</p>

<p>I added a “tutorial” for it as well in there. This was mostly to play around with <em>flex</em> layouts (the bulk of my CSS experience derives in a layout era where IE8 &amp; 9 were a high priority, aka before flex was close to standard).</p>

<p>One could argue this was really a ‘front-end’ project, and not a ‘visual design’ project. I am comfortable enough with CSS through years of using it that the bulk of my time and effort was spent understanding the isometric perspective. CSS is just a substitute for a graphics editor. I don’t intend for most projects in this focus to use code though, mostly because I ought to get practice in other environments.</p>

<h3 id="visual-design-path">Visual Design Path</h3>

<p>I don’t anticipate making a clear route for my visual design learning. There are specific things I want to learn at the tool level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Adobe Illustrator</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adobe After Effects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another animation tool (Maybe Framer)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are other potential tools as well — InDesign, XD, deeper Photoshop learning, new age CSS layouts.</p>

<p>Then there are specific areas of visual design I know I want to get practice on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Iconography</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data visualization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UI Elements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Web) Color Theory</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are other potential areas as well — logos, graphic design fundamentals, illustrations.</p>

<p>I don’t want to spend much of my time in reading about visual design. I’d say 20% of my time at max. This does <em>not</em> pertain to what my minor focuses are.</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote out notes for a few pages within CH 1. I am suspicious of writing out these notes as an time-effective tool. Typing them out would be (obviously) faster, which might aid me in going through repeititon of ideas faster, thus leading to acquired memories. I used writing under 10% of the time with <em>UPD</em>, I think I can apply the same logic here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ixd">IxD</h3>

<p><em>Typed</em> out my introduction notes that I originally wrote out. Retyping them out took much less time than the original writing (partially because you don’t have to parse them out from the book).</p>

<p>You could make the argument that, all else constant, writing out the notes is superior to typing them out in terms of remembering the content. The speed variable however allows for what I consider a more important technique for rembering: repeated exposure.</p>

<p>I think what I will do is continue to type out what I have written so far for Chapter 1, then retype out my notes, then compile key points and try them out on Anki.</p>

<h3 id="reinforced-learning">Reinforced Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>UPD:</em> Consolidated the cards back to only showing the term (used to also include the reverse, which shows the definition instead). Tested against 30 terms over 16 minutes, with all correct answers. Typed out answers. Number of terms should decrease overtime, assuming I continue to answer terms correctly.</li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <p>No more than 30 seconds to a term (62 minutes total for the entire deck).</p>

<p>Incorrect responses to:</p>

<p><em>Mimicry</em>, <em>Interference Effects</em> (gave definition for <em>Expectation Effects</em>), <em>Gutenberg Diagram</em></p>

<h3 id="whats-next-for-upd">What’s next for UPD</h3>

<p>I was surprised that I was able to do this well on the first attempt. I didn’t attempt any ‘cram’ studying for this, just what I’ve documented in this log up to this point. I was a little generous with what a ‘right’ answer is (e.g. mixing up the words ‘recall’ and ‘memory’, ‘method’ and ‘technique’), but not in a way that changed the meaning.</p>

<p>With these results, I mark the end of my first major focus — <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> is complete. As mentioned in previous logs, this will continue to receive passive work via spaced repetition, but won’t be actively worked on beyond that.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-postmortem-to-upd">A Brief Postmortem to UPD</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus began: October 10th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Final term added to Anki: December 6th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus ended: December 20th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Number of logged days: 40. There are 72 actual days between Oct 10th and Dec 20th.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a 2+ week hiatus towards the start — no entries between October 13th and November 1st.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am unsure of the total time commitment over those 40 sessions — many were well past 2 hours, some were under 30 minutes. I will take a guess and say the average session time was 90 minutes, or 60 hours of deliberate focus time to UPD.</p>

<p>My primary goal here is process goal, with quality of material learned a secondary goal. Overall, I would have liked for 40 sessions to <em>not</em> be spread out over 72 days, but this is still better than earlier periods of my life. The ratio of logged sessions to days is better if you discount my starting hiatus — 40 for 72 (55%) becomes 36 for 50 (72%), which is slightly above 5 days per 7 day week. This ratio is less important to me for an individual minor focus, but should be set high for cumulative minor focuses, and whatever the major focus of the time is.</p>

<p>In terms quality of material learned, I feel it will be dependent on its ability to synthesize with narrower, more in-depth specialties. For example, will it help me in learning Interaction Design? Visual Design? Research? Will it help me in articulating design to other designers, developers, stakeholders, and/or the general population? The book in of itself is just bullet points to many different ideas — being able to rattle off a definition for <em>accessibility</em> doesn’t make me an expert in the subject.</p>

<h3 id="next-major-focus-tbd">Next major focus: TBD</h3>

<p>I didn’t expect to easily pass my proposed metrics for UPD, and was hoping to delay having to make a decision on my next major focus for a few days. I suspect I will move forward with Visual Design as an umbrella major focus, and keep <em>IxD</em> in the minor slot. I’ll use the upcoming days to research out a general path for visual design, and at least make the commitment to move forward before the year ends.</p>

<p>Update: Did some research into what a visual design focus would look like. Peaked through some paid courses, wrote out a list of visualizations I want to practice. I don’t see an “end” to this focus — UPD had a much clearer “end”. I suspect that an “end” will be after some combination of a new focus of mine demanding the major spot, and after I have went through enough practical work in the subjects I want to tackle. As mentioned in earlier logs, process of learning, not quality of learning, is my top priority.</p>
